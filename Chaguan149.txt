全文文献: Eye-witnesses from 1972 offer their views of a relationship in bad shape
Half a century ago Richard Nixon took a gamble that made history. On a cold, hazy February morning, he landed in Beijing, the capital of a communist regime that America did not officially recognise, to meet China's ailing tyrant, Mao Zedong.
The president's stated motives were grandly visionary. China, home to a fifth of humanity, languished in angry isolation in 1972, its borders all but closed to the world. Desperately poor, its people were six years into the Cultural Revolution, a decade of ideological purges and violence at times approaching civil war. Nixon, a coldwar hawk who had spent years smearing opponents as soft on communism, had come to believe that a stable global order must include China. "We simply cannot leave China forever outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates and threaten its neighbours," Nixon wrote in 1967. His visit was a global sensation, televised live. Years later, it inspired an opera.
Yet alongside noble talk of ending China's isolation, Nixon and his foreign-policy adviser, Henry Kissinger, flew to China for secret, cynical reasons, too. With China and the Soviet Union on such terrible terms that Mao feared a Soviet invasion, Mr Kissinger and his president saw a chance for geometric diplomacy, to realign the global balance of power. In their plans, embracing weak China would usefully unsettle the mighty Soviet Union. They hoped it would also hasten the end of America's war in Vietnam, as North Vietnamese leaders realised it was time to sue for peace. The costs included betraying an ally. Nixon was ready to end diplomatic ties with a rival Chinese government, the Nationalist regime that had fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to Mao. The price of a successful visit in 1972 was a joint declaration, the Shanghai communique, in which America "acknowledged" that "all Chinese" agree that Taiwan is part of China, though it stopped short of accepting that the Communist Party should run the island.
Declassified American records of the visit reveal much relish for cynical realpolitik. Nixon and close aides calculated the benefits of each move to America, but also to the president's re-election campaign. They sighed about the brilliance and subtlety of Mao and his prime minister, Zhou Enlai, despite the horrors unfolding in China at that time. Fifty years on, China's leaders seem nostalgic for such values-free diplomacy, hinting that it offers the best way of repairing relations that are in dire shape. China's read-out of a telephone call on January 27th between the foreign minister, Wang Yi, and America's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, notes the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Shanghai communique, without mentioning Nixon's visit. Mr Wang cited a clause from the communique which talked of looking past essential differences in America's and China's social systems. He told Mr Blinken that a pre-requisite for peaceful co-existence, in 1972 or in the future, was each country eschewing any "intention to change the other". China's message seems to be: if 1972 made history, all credit goes to Mao's and Nixon's ability to weigh national interests coldly, and none to lofty rhetoric about ending China's isolation.
That being a bleak take on an important event, Chaguan sought advice from Chinese and Americans who remember the NixonMao visit. Shi Yinhong, an expert on America at Renmin University, was 20 years old in February 1972. He is sceptical that romantic visions about the family of nations moved either man. Mao chose to meet Nixon and emerge from strategic isolation as a calculated move to counter the Soviet Union, he says. Professor Shi is sure that Nixon's aims were similarly unsentimental: to get America out of Vietnam without China filling a regional vacuum, and to align with China against the Soviets. With the balance of power between America, China and Russia changed beyond recognition, he sees few lessons from 1972 that apply directly today. Even a renewed focus on national interests cannot help much, he worries, because America and China are determined to pursue stability "on their own terms", by maximising their respective power.
Very different memories move Zha Jianying, who in 1972 was a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Beijing. Her father, like many intellectuals, was in a labour camp. She recalls a life of shabby, propagandafilled monotony, and a fear that "maybe this is going to be the rest of our lives". Nixon's arrival, from long-demonised America, offered a first glimmer of hope by showing that "a different world exists", says Ms Zha, now a writer based in New York.
Ideology, practicality, despondency
Winston Lord, an aide to Mr Kissinger, attended the Nixon-Mao meeting as a note-taker. To him the visit involved both grand vision and realpolitik. If Nixon's initial impulse was to end China's isolation, while Mr Kissinger was at first focused on the balance of power, the pair soon shared both reasons for rapprochement, he says. To Mr Lord, later America's ambassador to China, it is a straw man to claim that the Shanghai communique was mostly a pledge to ignore ideology. To him, the genius of the communique lay in artful drafting which postponed intractable problems, such as Taiwan's final status, while allowing co-operation where possible.
In contrast, a diplomat and lead translator for the Nixon delegation, Chas Freeman, argues that America frittered away opportunities created in 1972 for a peaceful accommodation between Taiwan and the mainland. He urges America to push Taiwan to negotiate a settlement now, to avoid a war, though he concedes that Chinese rulers would roll back some democratic freedoms in Taiwan. "The most likely course of events is tragic," Mr Freeman says.
Trade and people-to-people exchanges were an afterthought in 1972, says Nicholas Platt, a diplomat on Nixon's trip who later served in America's first liaison office in China. In time "those more mundane issues became the relationship," he says, driven by "the power of curiosity" between America and China. Drawing China out was a noble goal in 1972. It remains one. But curiosity between China and the West is fading. A sad anniversary looms. *

摘要: Russia's economy, though ailing, complements China's, offering natural resources that can be supplied via pipelines and railways which are-in happy contrast with maritime supply routes-immune to blockade by foreign navies. Chinese and Russian diplomats and propaganda organs relay and amplify parallel narratives about the benefits of iron-fisted order over American-style dysfunction. Feng Yujun, director of the Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, suggests that as a commodities exporter, Russia can survive economic isolation, whereas "China's development hinges on being tightly connected to the world's industrial, value and supply chains."

全文文献: Headnote Shared hostility to America makes China close to Russia, but wary
China's relations with Russia are the strongest they have been for 70 years. When President Xi Jinping welcomes Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader he calls his "best friend", to a planned summit just before the Beijing Winter Olympics open on February 4th, powerful interests will bind the two men. China has capital to invest, technology to sell and an ever-growing appetite for oil, gas and other commodities. Russia's economy, though ailing, complements China's, offering natural resources that can be supplied via pipelines and railways which are-in happy contrast with maritime supply routes-immune to blockade by foreign navies. A sense of history unites the leaders. Both see a world order being reshaped by American weariness and self-doubt, creating chances to test and divide the democratic West. Chinese and Russian diplomats and propaganda organs relay and amplify parallel narratives about the benefits of iron-fisted order over American-style dysfunction. Joint military exercises demonstrate growing trust.
In a recent speech in Australia aimed at rallying "freedom-loving democracies", Britain's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, described China and Russia as aligned and "emboldened in a way we haven't seen since the cold war". In Washington commentators suggest that China and Russia see a shared interest in a Russian armed adventure in Ukraine that tests President Joe Biden's resolve and finds it wanting. Some go further, arguing that Mr Xi might watch an unchallenged Russian attack on Ukraine and conclude that he can safely invade Taiwan, the democratic, self-ruled island of 23m people that China claims for its own. In this telling, China's scruples about Ukraine mostly involve timing. An American news service recently claimed that Mr Xi asked Mr Putin not to attack during the Olympics, citing unnamed diplomats. China's embassy in Moscow called that report "a hoax and a provocation".
These being important questions, Chaguan sought the views of Chinese scholars who specialise in Russia. They call it ignorant to imagine that Communist Party bosses might endorse attacks on Ukraine, let alone see in it a trial run for an invasion of Taiwan. True, Chinese scholars usually grumble when foreigners doubt that China is anything other than a peace-loving giant. Such academics are also duty-bound to reject comparisons between foreign invasions and an assault on Taiwan, whose fate China deems a domestic question. More convincingly, Chinese experts sound sincerely insulted by the idea that conflict in Ukraine would set a precedent for something as grave as war over Taiwan. They do not hide their belief that Russia simply does not matter as much to America as China does. Indeed, they concede that China returns the favour, thinking more about confrontation with America than friendship with Russia. China-Russia ties may be closer than they have been since the days of Mao and Stalin, when the Soviet Union was China's "Big Brother", an overbearing but indispensable patron. That does not make them uniquely important.
China was a study in caution after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. In keeping with its obsession with its own territorial integrity, China abstained when the un Security Council considered the Ukraine crisis in 2014. Chinese officials blamed tensions on plots and meddling by hostile Western forces, rather than Russia. But China has never recognised Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, and has since worked to build trade with Ukraine. China criticised American and European sanctions imposed on Russian officials, banks and companies after 2014. But by and large Chinese banks and companies did not try to bust them, putting access to Western markets and financial systems first. China has helped Russia reduce its vulnerabilities to sanctions, making it easier to use Chinese yuan for some payments rather than dollars. Such initiatives have always been limited by Chinese capital controls, though. In 2014 Russian elites had "very naive expectations" of the help that China would offer, says Alexander Gabuev, a China expert at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a think-tank. Now the two countries are more realistic about each other, he says, and relations are the stronger for it.
China and Russia: aligned, but not alike
In China some nationalist professors with large social-media followings proclaim that Chinese firms would surely defy American sanctions imposed over a fresh Ukraine conflict. They predict that if America takes the dramatic step of cutting Russian banks' access to swift, an international payments system, China might build an alternative payments network with Russia, to challenge the dollar's hegemony. Other, more sober scholars are sceptical. Feng Yujun, director of the Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, suggests that as a commodities exporter, Russia can survive economic isolation, whereas "China's development hinges on being tightly connected to the world's industrial, value and supply chains." Mr Feng disagrees that China would profit from a Russia that isolates itself further from the West. Russia already seeks China's money, technology, markets and political support. How would China gain from a still more dependent Russia, he asks?
Yang Cheng, an expert on Russia at Shanghai International Studies University, suggests that a major conflict in Ukraine would bring few benefits to Mr Putin. But he also argues that America has few good options. For one thing, sanctions that hit Russian energy exports risk fuelling inflation that hurts America, he says. As for Russia's demands for sweeping security guarantees as a price for peace, Mr Biden can either accept them and duly confirm America's reduced clout, or reject them and risk turmoil in Ukraine. Still, Mr Yang sees no specific benefit to China in such a clash, for he is sure that America's foreign priority will remain "the grand strategy of containing China". He is not alone in his analysis. Seen from China, a skirmish in Ukraine is a risky sideshow, not a window on any future world order. *

全文文献: The Communist Party tries to keep the stressed middle class onside
Chinese nationalists and fans of liberal democracy do not often agree. Still, early this century, both groups sounded convinced of the subversive power of affluent Chinese buying American coffee. In 2007 a state television anchor growled that a Starbucks branch in the Forbidden City "trampled Chinese culture" (the branch closed the same year). In 2004 a New York Times columnist declared the Communist Party revolution "finished" once Starbucks entered China, because: "No middle class is content with more choices of coffees than of candidates on a ballot."
Both groups were mistaken. Nationalists should have been more confident about China's cultural power. With 5,400 outlets in China today, Starbucks thrives by adapting to local tastes, offering such items as the Lychee Ruby Chocolate Tea Latte. For their part, Western liberals have to date been proved wrong when they drew neat links between expanding consumer choice, individual spending power and, they assumed, a clamour for political freedoms and democracy. Four decades after the Communist Party embraced market reforms and opened to foreign investors, China's middle class has never been larger. Its members can choose where to live, work and how to spend their days in ways that would have been unthinkable 40 years ago. Yet under President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party exerts more control over more aspects of society and the economy than it has in decades.
One explanation for this puzzle lies in the party's ability to spot sources of mass discontent and present itself as the solution to them. Often, this involves depicting the party as the defender of a broad majority against a hostile, deviant or corrupt minority. Western liberals imagined that an empowered middle class would demand respect for their rights and dignity as individuals. Instead, Mr Xi, a canny populist, has a knack of spotting when a bit of repression may be welcomed by a public that feels overwhelmed by rapid changes in society or unbearable competition, and will cheer a powerful state cracking down in the collective interest.
Education policies unveiled in 2021 offer a revealing example. These respond to a real problem: unequal access to a small number of excellent schools and universities. Mr Xi prescribed a dose of egalitarianism, at a strength that shocked the education sector. The policies ban homework for the youngest pupils, abolish some early-years exams and promote practical and vocational learning, heeding Mr Xi's view that education should not focus too much on academic scores. In the name of equality as well as stress relief, China banned for-profit tutoring services for students in the nine years of compulsory education. Mr Xi had scolded private tutors for overburdening parents, who worry that others' children are learning more. Officials linked that pressure to China's plunging birth rate, which reached record lows in 2021. Tutoring firms are now allowed to register as non-profit enterprises, which means lowering prices by 80% or more. Even then they may not teach primary- or middle-school pupils at weekends or during holidays. Many have simply stopped teaching the core curriculum.
There will be losers. New Oriental, a big education firm, announced that it has laid off 60,000 of its 110,000 staff. If the whole industry follows suit, 6m tutors, most of them young graduates, will need new jobs. Then there are parents who hired tutors to help children struggling in schools where classes of 50 pupils are the norm. The government has told schools to provide low-cost evening classes instead, but their staff are already overstretched. "It's not practical to give special attention to one kid," says a veteran schoolteacher, who understands why many parents worry about the new policies, though he calls them "well-intentioned".
Middle-class parents do protest if they feel that they have been thrust, unfairly, into a disadvantaged minority. In 2019 parents at a school in the eastern city of Nanjing expressed outrage when staff eased off on exam preparation and homework as part of an experiment, while rival schools remained sternly academic.
Chaguan spoke to parents at a Beijing sports complex on a recent weekend, and found them focused on remaining in a protected majority. An affluent bunch, they had used tutors in the past. They acknowledge that individual choices are being curbed. That might logically make them oppose the policy. But they welcome a break from exhausting, inter-family competition. As long as the government stops everyone hiring tutors, says one father, none of his friends see the need to employ them. Prod a bit, and this lofty talk is qualified. A father watching his 13-year-old son take an American-football class confides that, before his child takes school-leaving exams, he will probably hire a (now illegal) tutor "to tackle his weak points". A mother says that she supports policies that stop children studying key planks of the curriculum with tutors long before taking them at school. But not all pressure can be eliminated, she adds: tough public exams will plunge children into "fierce competition" one day.
It will take more than a ban on tutors to make China equal
In Haidian, a university district, people in the tutoring business echo the egalitarian mood. The co-founder of a tutoring firm recalls how parental demand drove the industry's wild expansion. "Sometimes we felt a bit afraid about how fast it was growing," she says. Her firm hopes to make non-profit classes pay, subsidised by for-profit courses in drama and public speaking. Still, it may not survive. An education-technology expert now sells steaks online, citing government calls to help rural areas. "You need to go with the tide," he explains. Chaguan visits a new café opened by a 24year-old English tutor. The image of a trendy urban professional, he teaches part-time at a school but craves variety too much to work at a school full-time. Profit is not his motivation, he declares: "We should not judge a company by how much money it makes, but by its contribution to society and the nation." In middle-class China, his tone of conformist individualism fits right in.

全文文献: Headnote Lessons from a fatal Chinese collision with an American spy plane, 21 years ago
In an age of superpower rivalry and distrust, it is odd to talk of good fortune smiling on America's relations with China. But in one important domain, the rivals have shared a long streak of astounding luck. It is two decades since the last fatal encounter between the armed forces of America and China. Today the skies and seas around China swarm with a growing number of planes and warships from each side. In Beijing, scholars and officials talk of when, not whether another accident will occur. Then they wonder how such a crisis would be managed, by two countries locked in open ideological competition and stalked by rising nationalism.
The last incident involved a collision between a Chinese navy fighter and an American spy plane, high over the South China Sea on April 1st 2001. The Chinese pilot died after his jet broke apart. Badly damaged, America's naval reconnaissance plane, a lumbering, propeller-driven ep-3 with 24 crew aboard, limped to a Chinese military airfield on the tropical island of Hainan, landing without permission. The crew's detention by the People's Liberation Army (pla) was an early test for George W. Bush, who had been president for less than three months. The crew were freed just 11 days later, after America's ambassador to Beijing, Joseph Prueher, signed a letter saying his government was "very sorry" for the Chinese pilot's death. While noting that the ep-3 made an emergency landing to save its crew, the letter added that America was "very sorry", too, for the plane's arrival in Hainan without clearance. Through deft translation into Mandarin, China presented the letter as a formal apology. Party chiefs declared the pilot, LieutenantCommander Wang Wei, a revolutionary martyr and Guardian of the Sea and Sky. Official media told citizens to channel their grief into hard work to make China strong, and the country moved on.
In 2001 both governments took risks to end the stand-off. Chaguan covered the ep-3 collision during an earlier posting to China. Hours before the Americans flew home, he interviewed locals in a hot, rainy street near the Americans' detention place in Hainan. Ignoring police officers listening in, passers-by shouted that the ep-3 pilot should be put on trial. Irate university students told of campus protests squelched and of handwritten posters torn down. They were right to sense a fudge. For all their demands that America end surveillance flights near China, party chiefs signalled to Bush-administration envoys early on that they wanted a deal, in the interests of broader bilateral relations. Notably, China wanted entry to the World Trade Organisation and to host the 2008 Olympic Games, and America had leverage on both counts. After making clear his desire to see the dispute resolved, President Jiang Zemin left for a tour of Latin America.
America compromised, too. Pentagon officials gave reporters images of Wang Wei flying so close to American planes on previous missions that he could be seen holding up his email address. When debriefed later, the ep-3 crew from April 1st described the Chinese pilot making two reckless passes within ten feet (three metres), before misjudging a third and hitting one of their propellers. The pla account flouted laws of physics and common sense: that Wang Wei was a safe 400m away when the larger, slower ep-3 veered and rammed him. But to get the crew home, American negotiators set aside the question of blame.
Luck played a role in 2001. Mr Bush handed the crisis to his new secretary of state, Colin Powell, a pragmatist with unusual influence as a former general and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, able to get quick decisions out of the White House. Mr Prueher was a former admiral and head of Pacific Command, who as a naval aviator spoke with confidence about mid-air intercepts. That said, previous contacts with Chinese generals did not help, he recalls in a telephone interview. The pla was, he says, "non-existent in solving this problem. They did not answer my calls." The EP-3's survival was a stroke of fortune. Brigadier General Neal Sealock, who as America's defence attaché in Beijing led talks on the ground in Hainan, accords the EP-3 pilot "much honour" for saving his crew, thereby averting a catastrophe or even a war if 24 Americans had died in a crash, or, worse, been shot down. Powell's clout somewhat shielded American negotiators in China from Washington politics. Two decades on, a vastly more partisan Congress and media in America would surely denounce or obstruct any compromise like that struck by the Bush administration. Today, "if China is a problem, which it is, a bigger problem is sorting out the effectiveness and efficiency of our government," worries Mr Prueher.
All lucky streaks end eventually
For their part, Chinese nationalists would be harder to manage today. Most Chinese get their news from often-strident online outlets, rather than the staid television channels that played down the crisis in 2001. Chinese scholars see some positive changes, starting with the pla's growing capabilities. Zhang Tuosheng, a former military academic and diplomat, is an expert on crisis management at the Grandview Institution, a Beijing-based thinktank. In 2001, he says, American officers debated destroying their own plane on the ground to preserve its secrets, but thankfully decided against lobbing a missile at a Chinese airbase. China's modern-day strength should make America still more cautious now, he argues. Mr Zhang praises emergency hotlines and codes of conduct agreed by pla and American commanders over the years. But China and America remain fundamentally divided on how to avoid accidents, he concedes. The pla stresses "national security", meaning that America should stop coming near China. Americans stress "safety", meaning sober behaviour during close encounters.
Meanwhile, Chinese pilots are growing more aggressive. Since 2021 American and allied surveillance planes have logged multiple near-misses with pla aircraft, some, it is said, within 100 feet (30 metres). When complaints are lodged, China's response is: stay away. A disaster looms. Resolving it will be far harder next time.

全文文献: Headnote China's online nationalists see hostile foreign forces at every turn
An anxious world has long worried that rising nationalism might one day lead ordinary Chinese-especially the young- to outbursts of uncontrollable rage. If recent months are any guide, outsiders missed a more insidious threat: that anti-foreign paranoia would become a nasty but profitable game.
These are frightening times for Chinese civil-society activists, non-governmental organisations (ngos) and private businesses that see their role as building bridges between China and other countries. Nationalist bloggers, supported at times by media outlets controlled by the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, have spent months denouncing groups and individual campaigners for receiving foreign grants, or merely for relaying foreign concerns about China's growing impact on the world, even in such relatively safe fields as the environment.
Last year Paperclip, a maker of popular science videos, was attacked by online nationalists and driven out of business, accused of spreading anti-China hatred with a film noting that China is a big buyer of Brazilian soyabeans linked to deforestation in the Amazon, and saying that eating less meat is good for the planet. Online celebrities have been called race traitors for making videos about over-fishing, some of them for a British-headquartered charity, in which they urged Chinese to consume seafood more responsibly. Nationalists detect an "evil" agenda to deny China protein that Americans and Europeans wish to keep for themselves.
China House, a social enterprise based in Shanghai that promotes sustainable development in Africa, and that offers young Chinese opportunities to volunteer to help marginalised folk, faces ongoing attacks. It drew ire for drawing attention to discrimination faced by African migrants in southern China, and for investigating Chinese buyers of illegal ivory. Sai Lei, a blogger behind some of the loudest recent campaigns, declared China House's founder an er guizi, a contemptuous term for collaborators with Japanese occupiers in the 1930s and 1940s. Reposted by the Communist Youth League, his video has to date been viewed 5m times.
A veteran of the ngo world calls this the worst time for Chinese civil society since 1989. Yet this atmosphere of fear was not triggered by new government policies, or by a wave of arrests. Instead, disconcertingly, some of the most damaging attacks came from previously little-known social-media entrepreneurs. Still more shockingly, the secret weapon of these bloggers is to make antiforeign bigotry fun. Their core audience is young men aged 18-25. If followers are initially hooked by videos denouncing "anti-China traitors", their attention is kept with nationalist memes, conspiracy theories and dark in-jokes. Calling targets er guizi is only a start. Because state security services offer rewards of up to 500,000 yuan ($78,700) for reporting agents of a foreign power, those Chinese deemed unpatriotic are mocked online as "a walking 500,000" in anticipation of their denunciation as spies, or simply "500,000". Nationalism has become an entertainment industry. In the words of a Chinese liberal whose employer was targeted last year, nationalists discovered that videos about "anti-China" treachery generate clicks. "If you have a lot of clicks you become influential, and influence drives revenues."
Chaguan asked Sai Lei why he started making nationalist videos, after years of making explainer films about science and cars. Before agreeing to a telephone interview the 30-year-old, whose real name is Li Sirui, asked for questions in advance, citing his distrust of foreign media. He described his suspicion, starting in 2020, that a hidden agenda lay behind what seemed to be growing criticism of China. While relating his story, Mr Li mixed together many things that shocked him: comments by President Donald Trump about covid-19; bbc news reports about alleged forced labour in Xinjiang's cotton industry; and unsourced titbits that he had "read somewhere", such as a claim that pandemic face-masks donated by China "have Huawei chips in them". He called such claims "very clearly fake news" and added, "We need to be vigilant as to what the intent is behind all this." He insisted that his campaigns are not co-ordinated with officials in advance. "We are a private company, we're not connected to the government."
In this grim moment, those under fire are struggling to discern how closely clickbait nationalism aligns with the party's agenda. In the 1980s and 1990s overseas ngos and foundations were welcomed as they brought foreign economists and legal scholars to China and funded scholarships for Chinese to study in the West. That era is over. Today's Chinese leaders think the West at once less useful as a source of knowledge and more likely to be hostile.
Telling the Chinese that every foreigner is a potential spy
Now that they have fewer opportunities to co-operate with domestic reformers inside China, some international ngos have pivoted to lobbying China to be a more responsible global actor, on issues from climate change to illegal fishing far from home. That is a more confrontational role for outsiders to play. Pushing back at critics creates synergies between click-seeking online nationalists and national-security hawks, who never believed that foreigners would help China without expecting something in return.
In November law-enforcement officials accused Rendu Ocean, a non-profit that surveys marine pollution around China's coastline, of collecting oceanic data that could be used by spies. Later that month the Global Times, a tabloid often given exclusives by state security agencies, warned Chinese working for environmental ngos that they may be unwittingly aiding foreign "espionage activities", for instance when they host academic forums exploring China's intentions in climate negotiations. Such hostility sits awkwardly with President Xi Jinping's stated ambition for China to lead the world in "ecological civilisation". For now delegitimising critics with foreign links is useful. Whether that dynamic can easily be reversed is a problem the party will face another day. *

全文文献: Beijing's Winter Olympics may hasten a rift between China and the West
To a great number of Chinese, their country has never been as impressive as it is today. They see it as self-evident that China-their increasingly strong, modern motherland-is a worthy host of uplifting global events such as the Winter Olympics, which are set to open in Beijing on February 4th.
At the very same moment, an opposite consensus is forming in the West. In many free societies, China's rulers are increasingly seen as capable but cruel. They are credited with prodigious feats, whether that means girdling the nation with high-speed railways or sending rockets to the Moon. But they are seen as unbearably repressive, too, notably towards ethnic and religious minorities in such regions as Xinjiang. To Western sceptics, it is grotesque to allow the pageantry of the Olympics to be co-opted by such a regime.
That view has supporters in high places. In announcing that America will not send its customary delegation of grandees to cheer on Team usa at the winter games, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, restated the Biden administration's position that China's iron-fisted rule over Xinjiang-where as many as a million Muslims have passed through re-education camps- amounts to genocide. As a result, she declared, America should not help China pull off a triumphant Olympics. To use her words: "We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the games." A day later, Australia announced its own diplomatic boycott of the games, citing both China's record on human rights and its use of economic coercion to punish Australia for such offences as seeking an independent inquiry into the origins of the covid-19 pandemic. Others, from Britain to Canada and New Zealand, are declining to send government ministers or high-ranking officials.
China has responded with scorn, anger and censorship. The Olympics are a party "by invitation only" to which American politicians had not been asked, the foreign ministry's spokeswoman, Hua Chunying tweeted, though in reality each national Olympic committee issues its own invitations. Ms Hua's pugnacious deputy, Zhao Lijian, went further, warning of unspecified "firm countermeasures". "Speaking of genocide," Mr Zhao growled from a foreign ministry podium, "the us fits this label better than anyone else for the evil crimes they committed against Native Americans." Online, censors blocked most discussion of the boycotts.
Some commentators call these exchanges an empty war of words. They note that Western countries are still sending their athletes to the games, and they detect no new Chinese sanctions on America. Their insouciance is a mistake, twice over. First, these seemingly arcane official boycotts are a glimpse of a real-world diplomatic crisis. America's government uses the gravest of terms, including crimes against humanity, to describe China's behaviour in Xinjiang, where the party and its security agents have demolished mosques, jailed Muslims for such crimes as owning a Koran or praying in public, sent the children of detainees for patriotic education in orphanages and subjected millions more to hightechnology surveillance. Such language generates its own logic. Ms Psaki is surely right when she says that America's ties with China can no longer be "business as usual".
That stance is morally coherent. Even if China's own policy papers and work reports, public procurement documents and official speeches are the only evidence taken into account, its government is indisputably committing horrors in Xinjiang. But saying so makes it hard to have anything approaching normal relations, for all that the Biden administration insists that it has no beef with the Chinese public at large. At a time when many ordinary Chinese have rarely been so proud of their country, Western governments are telling them that they live in a form of pariah state.
Second, China's management of the games is itself likely to provoke mutual incomprehension between the publics of China and the West. The reason is covid. China has spent almost two years trying to eradicate the virus with ferocious testing and tracing regimes, by locking down whole towns when a handful of cases emerge, and by tightly controlling international borders.
Soon, many thousands will arrive from a world that is living with covid-though not foreign spectators, who are barred. China plans to manage this threat by sealing games venues inside secure bubbles. But it is inevitable that some participants will test positive or have fevers on arrival. Under China's rules, they will be hauled off to quarantine hospitals, and team-mates in close contact will be isolated in hotel rooms. In Beijing foreign embassies are anxiously sharing tales from a Luge World Cup staged as a test event last month. The sporting facilities were stunningly advanced but pandemic controls were a shock, from the moment a charter flight with over 200 athletes and sports officials landed in Beijing. Because two athletes were flagged as suspect on arrival, their plane-mates were held on airport buses for hours, forcing some to pee in bottles. On November 16th, diplomats relate, a German athlete was grabbed from the luge track by staff in hazmat suits after what turned out to be a false positive test, and isolated for two days before being declared safe. A Polish competitor injured by a faulty barrier on the luge track reportedly had to wait for a negative covid test before doctors would touch his shattered leg.
Some gulfs are too wide to bridge
China's controlling ways will extend to the press. A Western diplomat predicts "journalists will be kept like monkeys in a cage", denied free access to athletes. Yet if foreigners complain about a sinister "autocratic Olympics" many Chinese will be livid. They will see proof that Westerners are too irresponsible to control covid: witness the grumbling about being kept safe in Beijing. Outsiders will sound all the more ungrateful because 100,000 Chinese volunteers and staff working in the Olympic bubbles face 21 days of quarantine, away from home, at the end. Two worldviews are about to collide. The effects may be felt long after the final race. *

全文文献: Headnote Dysfunction in the West tempts the party to make risky boasts
The leaders of China's Communist Party have spent a long time waiting for liberal democracy to look as fragile as it does today. Now, filled with scorn for a dysfunctional West, they think that their moment has come. Angered, specifically, by President Joe Biden's summoning of over 100 countries to a virtual Summit for Democracy on December 9th and ioth-including Taiwan, an island that China claims as its territory-China is responding with fighting talk. Officials are seizing every chance to explain why their always-controlling, sometimes-ruthless political system is not just a good fit for a large country trying to become prosperous and strong: the party's defensive line for four decades. Increasingly, they are on the offensive. They insist that China's political model is so effective, and so responsive to the people's wishes, that it is more perfectly democratic than America's.
In the words of a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, American democracy is in a "disastrous state", calling into doubt that country's legitimacy as host of such a summit. In a video call, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, commiserated with his counterpart from Hungary, whose increasingly autocratic government is also not invited. Mr Wang condemned America for excluding some countries, adding that the yardstick of a democracy should be whether a government "meets the people's needs, and gives them enough of a sense of participation, satisfaction and gain".
The free world-meaning, broadly, societies in which governments can lose elections, and in which even the rich and powerful are (sometimes) held to account by independent judges, uncensored news outlets, opposition politicians and civic groups- should not underestimate this Chinese challenge.
Chinese talking points about one-party rule hold some appeal in more countries than Mr Biden may care to admit. That is not just true in states wooed with Chinese money or diplomatic backing for local despots. Lots of countries feel little nostalgia for the post-1945 era dominated by the American-led world order, and are eager for alternatives. In an online address to African leaders on November 29th, President Xi Jinping blended promises to send covid-19 vaccines and further open Chinese markets to African exports with talk of "true multilateralism" that delivers freedom, justice, democracy and development. He also criticised "intervention in domestic affairs, racial discrimination and unilateral sanctions". Mr Xi's audience will have heard a coded reference to China's willingness to block or water down American-led attempts to put pressure on rights abusers or kleptocrats in such forums as the un. In an article attacking Mr Biden's summit, co-written with Russia's ambassador to America, China's man in Washington, Qin Gang, went further. The pair called it a breach of the un Charter for any power to interfere in other countries' affairs in the name of fighting corruption or protecting human rights.
It is not new for autocrats to co-opt benign-sounding labels. During the cold war a quick route to a labour camp was to express dissent in a country with "democratic" in its official name, from North Korea to East Germany. Contrary to Mr Qin's state-centric description of the un Charter, tensions between state sovereignty and the protection of individual freedoms have lurked, unresolved, in that body's founding documents from the start. China's version of multilateralism ignores those tensions. But the swagger that lies behind China's claims to be "an extensive, whole-process socialist democracy", to quote Mr Qin's clunky phrase, is growing. That confident talk of Chinese-style democracy rests on some tendentious claims about the extent to which the public is consulted about new policies, and about the legitimacy that the party draws from much-vaunted successes, from controlling covid within China's borders to managing decades of economic growth.
Describing how governments earn mandates to rule, political scientists distinguish between input legitimacy (eg, an election victory), and output or performance legitimacy (ie, successful policies). China's rulers claim to enjoy input legitimacy based on public consultation, overseen by local and national "people's congresses". Yet the party does not permit elections that it could lose. Journalists who report errors hidden by state media are silenced or imprisoned, making it hard to talk of informed public consent. In Hong Kong, which formerly enjoyed many Western-style freedoms, the government is busy crushing a semi-democratic parliament and local councils with laws requiring members to be progovernment "patriots", while opposition politicians are jailed.
When the people's democratic dictatorship doesn't work
If hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue, rigged elections are a dictator's homage to real democracy: an admission that popular mandates offer moral authority. Bold claims for performance legitimacy are risky, too. If controlling covid gives Mr Xi a mandate, were his predecessors illegitimate when officials spent months mishandling an earlier deadly disease, sars? If the economy slows will the party, by its own logic, still deserve to rule?
The China Public Diplomacy Association held a "dialogue on democracy" in Beijing on December 2nd about what democracy is and who defines it. "China's democracy is not for the few, it is for the whole people," Lu Yucheng, a deputy foreign minister, told attendees. Alas, the system he described practices majoritarianism, not democracy. It is a form of tyranny in which individuals are crushed for displeasing the party, whether feminists, humanrights lawyers, gay activists, creators of art deemed "unhealthy", underground Christians or Uyghurs.
China is creating a zero-sum contest between autocracy and democracy. The timing is odd, for China still needs foreign knowhow to complete its rise. If countries know that Chinese success will be called proof of their decline, some may ask why they should help. Liberal democracies are in trouble. But as they ponder how to engage with an assertive China, they have a vote.

全文文献: Headnote A wall of censorship cuts China off from the world
It is hard to see a good ending to the story of Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis champion who on November 2nd accused a former Communist Party grandee more than twice her age of subjecting her to a coercive sexual relationship. In theory, the party deplores all immorality in office. When it suits the regime, propaganda outlets denounce purged officials for keeping mistresses as well as taking bribes. But China's rulers care still more about asserting their authority, and their exclusive right to decide which rotten corners of their system to expose and which to keep hidden.
Ms Peng, who is 35, was doomed from the moment she posted her late-night essay. In it she accuses a former member of the party's most powerful body, the Politburo Standing Committee, of imposing unwanted sex on her during an on-off decade-long affair. It is not the writing of an anti-party dissident. It is personal, even anguished in tone. It is filled with appeals to her alleged abuser, Zhang Gaoli, a former deputy prime minister in his mid-7os, as well as to her 588,000 followers on Weibo, a social-media platform. She notes that she left her family as a young child to enter intense sports training, and calls herself "extremely deprived of love". She also describes herself as a "very bad woman" but insists that she never took money from Mr Zhang. Nor did she try to collect evidence of their liaison, she adds, though she recalls his paranoia about secret recording devices.
Only a small minority of Chinese saw her essay, which was deleted within half an hour. Then censors moved to suppress discussion of it. Within the Great Firewall of censorship, online searches for Ms Peng or Mr Zhang pull up old news stories, with their comments functions disabled. It is difficult to estimate how many Chinese know of her allegations. It is clear that a large number do not.
The fate of Ms Peng could yet become grimmer. Other women have been punished harshly for challenging much less powerful men. When #MeToo campaigns emerged in China in 2018, feminist groups at universities were closed down and activists detained. True, some academics accused of gross abuses were fired. Sexual harassment was added to the country's civil code. But to preserve the party's grip on power, several women who went public with complaints were also crushed. When Zhou Xiaoxuan, a former intern at China Central Television, the main state network, accused a star presenter of groping her, police in Beijing initially urged her to drop the complaints for the sake of society, and for that of her parents' jobs in the public sector. In September Ms Zhou lost her suit against the presenter.
Sporting fame has given Ms Peng's case a double existence: censorship at home and intense attention overseas. After the Women's Tennis Association (wta), her sport's America-based governing body, said it had tried and failed for days to reach her by telephone, text or web message, champions including Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic expressed worry about her safety, as did several governments. In Beijing, the embassies of France and the European Union, among others, aired concerns.
In a bid to kill the story overseas, Chinese media outlets took to platforms such as Twitter, which are blocked inside China. This has not gone well. International alarm was fuelled, not soothed, by an English-language tweet on November 18th from cgtn, China's international television network. It claimed to show an email in which Ms Peng disowned her claims of sexual assault and said she was not missing, but "resting at home". The editor of Global Times, a party tabloid that is a favoured outlet for exclusives from state-security services, tweeted in English that foreign media should stop speculating that Ms Peng is in danger for accusing Mr Zhang of, as he coyly put it, "the thing that people talked about". His tabloid then tweeted what looked like staged videos of Ms Peng having dinner at a restaurant with her coach and meeting children at a tennis event.
Double fault
Ms Peng's case is revealing. Protected by a monopoly at home, Chinese propagandists struggle in foreign markets which enjoy competition in ideas. They have become reliant on stoking nationalism among the Chinese public and blaming all ills on hostile foreign forces. This time, because Ms Peng cannot be spoken of at home, jingoistic reinforcements are not available. The strain showed on November 20th when a commentator for cgtn accused foreigners of racism for demanding evidence of Ms Peng's safety. "Funny how some in the West feel people in China should be at their beck and call. Just another form of white male entitlement and privilege?" the commentator tweeted-a charge that might puzzle supporters like Ms Williams and Ms Osaka.
China remains skilled at using market power to browbeat foreigners. On November 21st Ms Peng spoke by video to officials at the International Olympic Committee (ioc). Olympic bosses said that the tennis player seemed well, while failing to address the reason why she might not be well, namely her assault allegations against a former Chinese leader. With the Winter Olympics opening in Beijing in February, the ioc and corporate sponsors have multi-billion-dollar reasons to help China make the Peng Shuai story go away. Therein lies a bleak lesson. The wta has been brave in challenging China, given that it has organised lucrative tournaments there. But as a women's sports association, it depends on retaining the confidence of women players. Sometimes there are incentives larger than China's market.
The silencing of Ms Peng does not just expose the ruthless, selfserving nature of one-party rule. It shows how reliance on China saps the ability of outsiders to stand up for individual rights. There is no evidence that Ms Peng wrote her essay for foreign eyes. But thanks to Chinese censorship, foreigners have ended up as her only witnesses. The world will draw lessons about the true nature of the party from her fate. *

摘要: According to the Chinese readout, Mr Biden also hailed China's 5,000 years of history, declared that his administration does not seek to change China's system of government and stressed that as America strengthens its global alliances, the aim is not to oppose China. Suitable topics include Afghanistan, trade, climate change, energy security, public health and the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran, Mr Biden suggested. With the American economy now in "bleak" shape, the Biden administration "needs to ease relations with China in order to improve its political standing at home", says Wang Yong, director of Peking University's American studies centre.

全文文献: Headnote Be glad that Presidents Xi and Biden are talking, but many dangers lurk
Beijing basked in golden sunshine on November i6th as President Xi Jinping spent more than three hours on a video call with his American counterpart, Joe Biden. After months of tensions, the virtual meeting was supposed to show that their countries could manage disputes and avoid a spiral of confrontation.
The two leaders' remarks matched the burst of mild weather. Mr Xi called Mr Biden an "old friend", nodding to hours that the two men had spent travelling and talking together in 2011, when each held the rank of vice-president. "I stand ready to work with you, Mr President, to build consensus, take active steps and move China-us relations forward in a positive direction," Mr Xi said.
China's state media announced, approvingly, that Mr Biden had offered reassurances on the most neuralgic points in the bilateral relationship. Notably, he had restated America's long-standing position that it does not support independence for the island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own. According to the Chinese readout, Mr Biden also hailed China's 5,000 years of history, declared that his administration does not seek to change China's system of government and stressed that as America strengthens its global alliances, the aim is not to oppose China. After months in which Chinese censors have tolerated online mockery of Mr Biden as a doddery shuiwang, or "sleep king", prone to napping during meetings, official outlets carried side-by-side images of Mr Biden and Mr Xi beaming and waving at one another online.
The White House, for its part, described a businesslike meeting. It quoted Mr Biden as telling his counterpart: "Our responsibility as leaders of China and the United States is to ensure that the competition between our countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended." American officials are conscious that political opponents at home are eager to accuse Mr Biden of appeasement or of entering endless talks that go nowhere. The national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, duly described Mr Biden confronting Mr Xi over human rights, unfair trade practices and bullying of Taiwan. Mr Biden urged Mr Xi to send "senior and empowered" officials to meetings to make progress on pressing issues, rather than pursue "dialogue for dialogue's sake", Mr Sullivan told a post-meeting briefing at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Suitable topics include Afghanistan, trade, climate change, energy security, public health and the nuclear programmes of North Korea and Iran, Mr Biden suggested.
The video call was a far cry from a traditional summit between American and Chinese leaders. Such events are preceded by months of wrangling by officials over concessions, promises and deals so sensitive that only the top leaders can make them. It says much about the dire state of relations that this conclusion-free meeting-held online because Mr Xi has not left China or met a foreign leader since the covid-19 pandemic began-counts as a modest breakthrough.
In early September Mr Xi was shockingly testy at the start of a telephone call with Mr Biden, say people briefed on its contents. In that conversation, Mr Xi essentially rehearsed, in private, the same argument levelled by officials in public, namely that America is bent on containing China's rise and is to blame for all present-day tensions. The argument's second part is that President Donald Trump was a bad leader, but that Mr Biden is the same or worse because-as a more rational politician-he should know better. More emollient signals were sent by China on October 6th when Mr Sullivan met Mr Xi's most senior foreign-policy aide, Yang Jiechi, in Switzerland. Western and Chinese sources describe Mr Yang explaining that China seeks a calm external environment in 2022, to avoid disrupting events including the Beijing Winter Olympics in February and a year-end Communist Party congress at which Mr Xi is expected to launch a third term as party chief.
In this low-trust moment, Mr Biden and Mr Xi are arguably the only American and Chinese officials able to have substantive discussions. Their video chat was better than nothing, but worryingly limited. When it comes to co-existing sustainably, the two sides are far apart. Mr Biden says that America and China are locked in an intense competition, which must be managed responsibly. Chinese officials call that framing too negative. They prefer talk of relations based on mutual respect and mutual interests: code for a realist America realising it has no choice but to accommodate China's autocratic, statist ways.
China's plan for world peace: America stops defying China
Mr Biden is presented in China as a more pragmatic president than his predecessor. Alas, scholars and state media frame his willingness to talk as an admission of American failure. In China's telling, American inflation is linked to Trump-imposed trade tariffs (though inflation is recent and tariffs have been in place for three years). Chinese analysts blame another complex problem, supplychain chaos, on a simple cause: Trump-era attempts to block exports of semiconductors and other advanced technology to China, while urging firms to move factories out of China. With the American economy now in "bleak" shape, the Biden administration "needs to ease relations with China in order to improve its political standing at home", says Wang Yong, director of Peking University's American studies centre. Professor Wang adds that America is losing the hearts and minds of younger Chinese, who have "given up their illusions" that the West is sincere when it expresses concerns about Muslims in Xinjiang or democrats in Hong Kong.
China's leaders still want investment and technology from the West, but they think it is in decadent decline and are decoupling from Western norms and ideas. One video call cannot begin to fix a relationship in crisis. Mid-November often brings spells of sunshine to Beijing, which do not last. In China's ancient, 12-season calendar, the freezing periods called "small snow" and "big snow" are next. Relations with America face a similar ice age. *

全文文献: Headnote Harsh rules enjoy support, as long as a majority feels safe
Nearly two years into the covid-19 pandemic, China's propaganda machine is locked in a futile argument with the outside world. The row is about whether this giant country is paying too high a price for its "zero-covid" policy. China's attempts to eliminate the virus, rather than merely manage it, are certainly costly. They have largely closed China's borders for 19 months. Dozens of city districts, towns and counties are enduring lockdowns as the highly contagious Delta variant and an early cold snap cause a flare-up of infections. There are several hundred cases of the disease nationwide. Many of them are local transmissions rather than imports from abroad, underscoring Delta's perils. Controls include roadblocks manned by police in protective suits, closed schools, cancelled trains and testing of millions of residents.
With officials facing punishment for cases on their watch, grassroots harshness abounds. The northern city of Heihe has declared a "people's war", with rewards of up to 100,000 yuan ($15,600) for residents who report such pandemic crimes as illegal hunting. A county in Inner Mongolia locked nearly 10,000 tourists in hotels for two weeks to smother an outbreak. Two pharmacies in suburban Beijing lost their licences for selling fever-reducing medicines to a couple without logging their names in a virustracking database. The customers, who had earlier visited areas with covid cases and later tested positive, are being prosecuted for failing to report to a fever clinic. Citing possible transmission risks, officials in cities including Chengdu, Harbin and Wuxi entered the homes of quarantined locals and killed their pet cats.
Officials reject foreign reports that call such measures unsustainable. "It's simply not right to question China's efforts to eliminate the virus," complained Xinhua, a state news agency, citing the country's "robust" economy and calling travel curbs a "minor inconvenience". Hu Xijin, the editor of a tabloid newspaper, says foreigners are jealous of China's virus-fighting record, and charges that America has eased pandemic controls because it values "money over life". In fact, the two sides are talking past one another if they focus on how strict zero-covid policies are. It is more relevant to ask who feels the pain from those controls. They are best understood as a giant utilitarian experiment. To help the majority enjoy an orderly, covid-free existence, a hapless minority-notably those who catch the virus or are suspected of contact with carriers-must sacrifice individual liberties, privacy and dignity.
A focus on the interests of the majority resonates with many Chinese. They remember images of chaos in Wuhan last year, as the virus overwhelmed hospitals in that city of 10m. They know that the health system is weaker outside big urban centres. Many doctors in rural clinics lack university degrees. Intensive-care beds are rare. American-style pandemic policies could have led to millions of deaths. As for closed borders, which cause anguish to expatriates and Chinese with family overseas, they do not greatly pain the 87% of the population without passports.
Many citizens of democratic countries would not tolerate half the rules imposed on China in this pandemic. But the collective sacrifices of the Chinese have produced something remarkable. In a country of 1.4.bn people, the official total death toll from the pandemic is under 6,000, compared with almost 808,000 excess deaths in America, which has less than one-quarter of China's population. Some scepticism of China's statistics is reasonable, given that officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected, concealed the virus for weeks in late 2019 and early 2020. Yet if large outbreaks were still being concealed today, control systems would start breaking down, for they rely on tracking and tracing fresh cases. Instead, life in much of China is relatively normal.
Strictness for the greater good continues to enjoy unmistakable public support. But Chinese leaders do face a risk whenever public opinion suspects that overly harsh lockdowns actually serve the interests of a minority, ie, officials eager to cover their backs. There are signs of disquiet. Chengdu, for instance, recently broadened its pandemic controls, testing 82,000 people whose mobile telephones had spent ten minutes within 800 metres of a suspected case. Other cities have started copying this approach. But on November 8th two leading epidemiologists and a doctor in Chengdu wrote an open letter warning pandemic officials that such mass testing must be guided by science, and risks causing panic. That officials keep talking about punishing rule-breakers is a sign of at least some public fatigue. It also risks driving the weary to hide from the authorities.
The party calls pandemic control proof that it loves the people
To maintain support, strict controls must be seen to benefit everyone, though a minority will feel the most hardship. Foreigners in China, yearning for borders to open, often suggest that the sight of normality in the rest of the world will soon make Chinese citizens restless. For now, state media keep such envy at bay by presenting the West as a death-stalked hellhole. An online video promoted this week by state media is filled with images of Donald Trump when he was America's president, and the chaos abroad of those days. It calls American travellers "walking vectors of contagion".
To date, zero-covid's worst effects have been felt by luckless minorities, from locked-down residents to those whose livelihoods depend on free movement within and outside China. Fear, and the stigma endured by those who catch the virus, have ensured compliance with orders. Harsh policies have bought China's leaders time, as they wait for potent vaccines and antiviral drugs that might let them open up safely. Officials have arguably slowed an exit by refusing to approve foreign vaccines that are more effective than China's, in their eagerness to prove the superiority of one-party rule over Western democracy. Further mutations of the virus may one day challenge China's strategy. If they make lockdowns more frequent, the ranks of the unlucky will grow. *

全文文献: Headnote A revealing visit to a rural county that gets help from the foreign ministry
SINCE THE Ming dynasty, Chinese who are oppressed by local officials have sighed, by way of explanation: "The heavens are high, and the emperor far away." An earthier variant runs: "With no tiger in the mountains, the monkeys are in charge." Today's Communist Party bosses have no time for such cynicism. They want the masses to believe that, even in the remotest villages, their welfare is the concern of an all-knowing leader, Xi Jinping, served by officials striving to follow his stern but wise example.
Inspiring the public is not the party's only concern. A central task of the Xi era is to transform morale among the country's 90m party members, including millions of bureaucrats. Officials are told that they serve a rising China, whose growing strength is the awe of the world. Since Mr Xi became supreme leader in 2012, party membership has been presented as something close to a secular priesthood, in which a select few selflessly serve the masses. Government ministries in Beijing play their part in spreading the faith. Their high-flying staff-almost always party members- compete for the career-enhancing honour of a stint as grassroots officials in impoverished villages and towns.
Central government departments have sponsored a growing number of poor counties around the country since 1992, when the State Council first urged ministries to pair up with left-behind places. Chaguan recently spent four days in Malipo, a remote county of conical, cloud-topped hills, terraced fields and fruit orchards in the southern province of Yunnan, on the border with Vietnam. Malipo has been sponsored for 29 years by the foreign ministry, which organised (but did not pay for) this reporter's visit with a delegation of officials from the national and provincial governments. The ministry uses its connections to help the county, which was declared free of extreme poverty in 2019 and last year recorded an average income per person of 11,984 yuan ($1,874). Foreign embassies and businesses have donated school buildings, books and scholarships. On October 17th America's National Basketball Association donated a new basketball court to a middle school in Malipo (the nba is still trying to mend fences in China after a coach signalled support for Hong Kong's democrats, triggering nationalist fury). "Of course this is thanks to the foreign ministry," said the headmaster, as teenage pupils intently copied the moves of visiting nba coaches, or shyly asked them for autographs. The nearest city, Wenshan, used to be hours away along winding roads. A new motorway opened on October 1st, following lobbying by the foreign ministry. A diplomatic charity raised funds to build clean water systems for villagers who previously fetched water by hand.
Dozens of younger diplomats have done stints as volunteer teachers in primary schools in villages. More importantly, the ministry sends a mid-ranking official to serve for a year or two as Malipo's deputy county chief. Duties include conducting foreign policy, for officials in Yunnan must talk to Vietnamese counterparts about exchanges of students or travel permits for ethnic minorities whose lands straddle the frontier. Both sides regularly clear landmines from border areas-a lethal legacy of China's brief invasion of Vietnam in 1979, which still costs locals limbs.
Domestic tasks also loom. The ministry's current man in Malipo, Chen Minghuang, served in Japan for several years. In addition to seeking inward investments for the county, he is, among other things, responsible for water quality in several rivers. Asked why a non-specialist can be entrusted with such work, a local official praises foreign-ministry volunteers for their promotional skills. Diplomats may not know how to raise a pig, but they can spot what makes a pig from Malipo marketable, she enthuses.
Chaguan ventures at one point that an Oxbridge-educated British diplomat may receive a thin welcome if sent to help run a county in rural Scotland, without any experience in local government. China is not so hung up about elitism, it turns out. The foreign ministry sends "the best of the best", responds an official from Beijing. It sends party members, because they are expected to be moral exemplars. "Compared with the masses, party members represent more progressive and developed forces. That's how they can help the people," says the visitor from Beijing. A yearslong anti-corruption drive has created a culture of honesty among officials of all ranks, she adds. At an agricultural training base, local officials offer a broad defence of rule by technocrats. Farmers may not understand which crops will grow well, and which will make money, says a county official. The role of experts is to guide them to harness market forces.
Heaven near at hand, and the emperor close by
Some may dismiss all this as a mere propaganda tour. Certainly, the delegation was only taken to handsomely restored villages and model farms, and greeted by folk dancers at every turn. It would take many days of independent reporting to assess the foreign ministry's help, not to mention its sustainability. Malipo is just one of 88 counties in Yunnan formerly ranked as extremely poor.
But a visit to Malipo is a window on something else important. Lots of officials are increasingly proud of the system they serve, especially as they survey what they regard as chaos in the West. More than before they talk openly about the party's role in that system. As Mr Chen puts it, millions of party members are working towards the same goals, guided by strong leaders. He describes the changing views of Malipo's masses as they see their roads being paved, and houses and schools restored. "The central government always enjoyed a high status in people's minds. Now local government's reputation has also risen," Mr Chen says.
Mr Xi's China remains a big country with complex problems, run by men who see a world full of hostile forces. But the domestic confidence of its ruling party is unmistakable. Outsiders miss that tigerish swagger at their peril.

全文文献: Headnote An anti-superstition drive is about order and control, not smashing tradition
For several big reasons it is misleading, even morally indecent, when commentators assert that China is embarking on a new Cultural Revolution. It is true that the Communist Party is today more visible and assertive than at any time since Mao Zedong's death in 1976. After Xi Jinping became China's leader in 2012, he unblushingly re-emphasised the party's authority over everything from the machinery of state and the armed forces to the judiciary, universities and news media.
It is also true that the rich and famous are under harsher scrutiny than they have known for decades. Tycoons and film stars have received painful reminders that they enjoy their success at the party's pleasure. Some have lost fortunes or seen careers ended for defying China's leaders, or for provoking public opinion with displays of swaggering privilege. Others have hastened to donate money and time to patriotic causes. New rules ban effeminate actors from television and curb how many hours youngsters spend on video games. State power is now invested in one man, Mr Xi, in a way not seen since the Mao era. Whether issuing textbooks in Xi Jinping Thought to six-year-old children or using smartphone apps to ensure that officials study Mr Xi's wisdom, the leader's sternly paternal presence is felt in every corner of life.
Yet this is not a return of the Cultural Revolution. Most simply, between 1966 and 1976 Mao and his inner circle unleashed such horrors on China that it dishonours their victims to take that decade's name in vain. Scholars outside China, drawing on often-secret official reports from the 1980s, estimate that 1.6m died, with the lives of many millions more ruined. Much attention has been paid to the youngest Red Guards: Mao-revering students or youths who persecuted everyone from ex-landlords to intellectuals and artists, religious believers and, not least, officials accused of being reactionary. But more casualties died in fighting between rival, adult Red Guard factions or with army units. The violence at times resembled a civil war, set in motion after Mao came to doubt the loyalty and revolutionary fervour of the ruling establishment. In contrast, Mr Xi and his inner circle are iron-fisted party-builders, not friends to rebels. They have purged internal rivals, dissenters and the corrupt. The party is now attacking what it deems the excesses of capitalism. The goal is stability and conformity, with all China marching in lockstep towards national greatness.
Those are large reasons to avoid miscasting Mr Xi as a second Mao. But there are myriad smaller ones, too. By way of a case study, consider an ongoing campaign against "superstitious" ways of mourning the dead, specifically by burning imitation banknotes and paper models of goods that loved-ones might need in the afterlife. In addition to funeral offerings, goods are burned for the dead at various annual holidays. One coming soon is Hanyi Jie, or the Winter Clothing Festival, when paper replicas of warm clothes may be seen burning on city pavements or in village courtyards. In August nationwide debate was sparked by news reports that Shanxi, a northern province, had drafted rules banning the making or selling of funeral supplies, such as paper models of people, horses and houses; or imitation money. This was not the first such online uproar. Other provinces, cities and counties have tried to stop or restrict the burning of paper offerings several times. Officials call the practice superstitious, a source of air pollution, a fire hazard and extravagant, scolding citizens to spend money on caring for the old, not when burying them.
China's best-known paper funeral-goods come from one place. Mibeizhuang, an unlovely village in Hebei province 120km south of Beijing, was famed for silk flowers as far back the Qing dynasty. Locals boast that wreaths at Mao's funeral came from Mibeizhuang. The village became a nationwide hub for funeral-goods when market reforms began in the 1980s. When Chaguan visited on a recent weekday, shopkeepers had bundles of paper suits and fur-collared coats ready for Hanyi Jie. A group of four men, funeral organisers from Wu'an, a rural town 400km to the south-west, loaded a small truck with cardboard models of trees covered in gold coins, food-stuffed fridges, televisions and pink, colonnaded mansions. A set of such models sells for less than 50 yuan ($7.76).
For centuries in China, honouring the dead lay at the heart of codes of virtuous behaviour. In imperial times, children studied models of filial piety including Dong Yong, a man so poor that he sold himself into servitude to bury his father properly. During the Cultural Revolution, ancestral and clan temples were ransacked, while family altars in Chinese homes were smashed by Red Guards or hidden for safety by their owners. When victims of Maoist violence were burned or buried without ceremony, the lack of proper rites was an extra stab of agony for grieving families.
The party will not admit it, but Mao traumatised China
Today, once-cherished customs have a markedly weaker grip. Asked whether customers believe that burned funeral-goods reach relatives in the afterlife, traders in Mibeizhuang are incredulous. "What day and age is this? It is just a tradition," says one. A third-generation seller of paper offerings scoffs: "I don't even believe in it. Spending money on this stuff is like throwing it away."
The traders have watched injunctions against their industry tightening for years, especially in cities. They are cynical, saying that officials who oppose burning funeral-goods will sneak home to burn paper models for their own parents. But they are resigned to the possibility that their trade may end one day. "We set off firecrackers for thousands of years. Now it is not allowed and has stopped," explains one, calling modern-day Chinese "obedient".
It is hard to start new rows about feudal superstition, precisely because the Cultural Revolution tore up so many roots that tied Chinese to the past. Today's China is bossy, socially conservative and relentlessly controlling. Its rise as an authoritarian giant is disruptive enough without mistaking it for Maoist fanaticism.

摘要: In the name of market opening and fair competition, the cptpp's current members-Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam-agree to limit subsidies for large state-owned enterprises (soes), permit most cross-border flows of data and outlaw forced labour, among many other promises. [...]there are exemptions for local-government soes and those delivering unprofitable domestic services. In accession talks China may accept regulation of soes operating abroad in profitmaking commercial sectors, while insisting that state firms at home are needed to supply jobs, manage critical resources or maintain an orderly financial system.

全文文献: Headnote China's motives for joining the cptpp range from benign to worrying
Sometimes china makes shrewd decisions. At other times it is capable of grave mistakes, even acts of wickedness. But the Chinese government is rarely silly. In particular, officials do not stake the prestige of their supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, on a whim. That makes it worth revisiting dismissive foreign reactions to a move that, though dry-looking, is important and revealing.
On September 16th China formally asked to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (cptpp), an 11-nation trading block that is home to 500m consumers in Asia and the Americas. Though China's timing was sudden, the move was predictable. Months ago Mr Xi said China would "favourably consider" applying. His word is law. But many foreign analysts (and in private, some foreign government officials) confidently predict that China will never be admitted.
Scepticism is understandable. In the name of market opening and fair competition, the cptpp's current members-Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam-agree to limit subsidies for large state-owned enterprises (soes), permit most cross-border flows of data and outlaw forced labour, among many other promises. If those standards seem hard for China to meet, given its statist, security-obsessed turn in recent years, that is no accident. The cptpp is the orphaned offspring of an earlier, American-led agreement, the tpp. That was crafted by the Bush and Obama administrations with the aim of making Asia and the Pacific into a bastion of rules-based free trade, leaving China with the choice of reforming its model of state-dominated capitalism or remaining on the outside. Then came President Donald Trump, whose scorn for free trade and indeed rules led him to quit the tpp on his first full day in office. When Japan guided other founding members to forge a Trump-less alternative, the cptpp, China spotted an opening.
Officials in Beijing have spent two years studying how hard it will be for China to join. Their conclusion is that China will find accession arduous, not least because of strained relations with existing members who have a veto, notably Australia, Canada and Japan. But they also reckoned that China would face still harsher scrutiny were America to be inside the сртрр-a distant prospect currently, due to Biden administration pledges to put American workers ahead of corporate profits and expanded global trade.
China, in short, is serious. Its ambition is best explained by different forms of rising confidence, some more alarming than others. Start with a benign, cautious optimism among those sometimes called reformers. That camp once promoted economic liberalisation. In a China intently focused on political control, stability, security and self-reliance, reformers now find it safer to push for a more efficient state, not a smaller one. These scholars, technocratic officials and business types argue that China is so strong and technologically advanced that it gains, on balance, from removing barriers to trade and upholding common international rules, for instance to protect Chinese intellectual property. Such advocates of openness believe that China can compete in a freetrading world, but is not yet ready to write trade regulations on its own. They welcome a chance to help shape norms during negotiations such as the cPTPP-accession process, which they expect to take years. They hope that external pressure will overcome special interests at home, as happened when China joined the World Trade Organisation (wto) in 2001. Given the consensus in official Beijing that America is bent on thwarting China's rise, pressure from the сртрр-a pact without America in it-is especially welcome. Wang Huiyao runs the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank that champions cptpp entry. China's economy has grown 11-fold since admission to the wto, he notes. It is "an easy sell" to call cptpp a new chance to join a mini-WTO.
A different sort of confidence moves nationalists, including government leaders, who embrace the cptpp. They do not just think China's state-led system capable of competing in the world. They think it is manifestly superior. Nationalist-minded Chinese officials and scholars think that market forces bring desirable efficiencies, but their priority is stability, which they see as China's secret weapon. As exhibit a they point to their strict, collective handling of the covid-19 pandemic, in contrast with grim death tolls in the freedom-obsessed West. Their gamble is that joining the cptpp will increase foreign trade and impose useful disciplines, without undermining strong political control of the economy. They sense a historic chance to advance a cherished goal, namely to make the world respect China's political system.
Sceptics about China's chances assert that cptpp rules ban subsidies and aid for state firms. In fact there are exemptions for local-government soes and those delivering unprofitable domestic services. In accession talks China may accept regulation of soes operating abroad in profitmaking commercial sectors, while insisting that state firms at home are needed to supply jobs, manage critical resources or maintain an orderly financial system. China's ever-stricter rules about cross-border data flows will be harder to finesse, though public-order exemptions may help. China simply denies it has forced labour, daring trade partners to disbelieve it.
America vows to work with allies, then doesn't
The biggest barrier to China's entry is not this or that rule, but trust. A senior Japanese official expresses worry about China offering to write domestic laws that purport to comply with the CPTPP, but fall short. It would be easier to challenge such moves with America at the table, he sighs. Fears are justified. China has a free-trade pact with Australia, but is currently blocking many exports from that country, in an unofficial boycott imposed after Australian leaders called for a global probe into covid-19's origins. Some cptpp members think China is too big a bully to join. China's bet is that, for a decisive number, it is too big to keep out. *

全文文献: Surprisingly often, Chinese diplomacy resembles an iron fist in a silk glove. Depending on political winds back home, China's envoys learn to balance fist-waving threats with silken words about peace and friendship. Just now, the gloves are coming off.
China is in a triumphant mood after Meng Wanzhou, a boss at Huawei, a technology firm, was allowed to fly home on September 25th after almost three years of legal battles in Canada. Ms Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, was fighting extradition to America on charges relating to sanctions-busting business dealings with Iran. Celebrations peaked with the arrival of an Air China plane bringing Ms Meng to Shenzhen, where Huawei is based. State television carried the landing live, as if Ms Meng were a returning astronaut. She was greeted by flag-waving crowds and a welcome message blazing from Shenzhen's tallest skyscraper. "Without a powerful motherland, I would not have my freedom today," declared Ms Meng. The People's Daily, the Communist Party's official mouthpiece, called her return a sign that China's rejuvenation as a great power is now a "historical inevitability".
Neither the businesswoman nor state television mentioned a less stirring reason for her return: her signing, hours earlier, of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement offered by American prosecutors, admitting that in 2013 she misled bankers in New York about Huawei's links to a company active in Iran. That legal deal ended what Ms Meng called 1,028 days trapped in a dark "abyss". By this she meant her enforced stay in Vancouver, while her team of expensive lawyers fought her extradition after her arrest by Canadian police in December 2018 on an American warrant. Granted bail, Ms Meng lived in her own house, took painting lessons and English classes, and was free to explore Vancouver by day.
Nor, at first, did state television discuss the almost-simultaneous departure from China of a plane carrying two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. The two were snatched by secret police in 2018 just days after Ms Meng's arrest, an act that Canada's government called an "arbitrary detention". Kept alone in a cell measuring nine square metres, Mr Kovrig wrote to his family of passing time with meditation, press-ups, reading when allowed and walking 7,000 paces a day, ears ringing from the silence. The pair were allowed access to lawyers only after a year of detention and interrogations lasting for up to eight hours at a time.
For a day or two after Ms Meng's return, state media barely reported the two Canadians' release. Indeed, censors deleted postings by Chinese netizens asking about rumours that "Canadian spies" had been freed. Asked if Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor had been hostages swapped for Ms Meng, the foreign ministry's chief spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, called the cases completely different. It is "crying wolf" to suggest that China would detain foreigners on trumped-up charges, added Ms Hua, before accusing America and Canada of the arbitrary detention of Ms Meng.
Some foreign commentators express surprise that China sprang Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor on the same day that Ms Meng began her journey home. Given that China says it deplores hostagetaking, surely it should wait a bit before exchanging foreigners for Ms Meng. Puzzlement misses the point. China wants the world to know that it is willing to grab foreigners, if needs be. More than once, court hearings and legal moves against Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor tracked important moments in Ms Meng's extradition battle. The message was that the cases were linked.
This is not a guess. Months into the detention of Mr Kovrig and Mr Spavor, Chaguan discussed the case with a Chinese official at an event in Beijing. By then, Canadian diplomats had seen both men for tightly controlled consular visits. Mr Spavor is an entrepreneur who organised tours into North Korea. He was locked up in the north-eastern city of Dandong, near the North Korean border, and would later be sentenced to 11 years for spying. Prosecutors said he took pictures at airports and other banned locations, including of military planes, and was Mr Kovrig's informant.
Mr Kovrig was a diplomat at Canada's embassy in Beijing before joining the International Crisis Group (icg), a think-tank. During hours of interrogations, he was asked about his work for icg but also about his role at the embassy, when he enjoyed diplomatic immunity. Word of this spread to other embassies in Beijing. In private conversations, diplomats called it "frightening". Chaguan raised this with his host, asking how it helps China to scare Western diplomats. The official's tone became icy. Canada must feel pain, he replied, so that the next time America asks an ally to act against China, that country will think twice.
The rule of law with Chinese characteristics
There are coherent arguments that China could make against Ms Meng's detention, drawing on its dislike of extraterritorial sanctions and prosecutions by America. Instead, in explaining her case, officials mostly present a cynical view of the law as a tool by which power is exercised. The party line is that a jealous America tried to break Huawei as a high-tech champion but was stared down by a stronger China. No details are offered. If relations with the West are turbulent, that is because national rejuvenation is close at hand. To quote Xinhua, the state news agency, Ms Meng's arrest was prompted by China's rise and "so was her release!"
Within China news is spreading of the Canadians' deportation, ostensibly on health grounds. Propaganda chiefs see an interest in publicising a claim by the White House that Ms Meng's release was decided by prosecutors without political interference and denying that she was swapped for two Canadians: a claim that netizens find risible. Guancha, a nationalist website, created a hashtag mocking the White House statement, inspiring social-media posts that have been read over 300m times. Anti-American glee is hard to reconcile with official half-denials that China takes hostages. China seems to sense a moment for fists, not gloves. *

全文文献: Headnote To China, the new alliance is proof that America's plan is containment
For chínese leaders, the rows about aukus, a new security pact between America, Australia and Britain, confirm cherished prejudices about the Western world. China has always believed that America's network of global alliances is a cover for hegemony, even if American leaders offer warm words about defending universal values, standing up for friends and opposing "attempts by stronger countries to dominate weaker ones", as President Joe Biden did at the un on September 21st.
Chinese suspicions are, in this case, bolstered by French anger over aukus, which was born out of Australia's decision to break a deal to buy diesel-electric submarines from France, in favour of buying nuclear-powered ones from America. When a French government minister accused Britain of returning to the American fold and "accepting a form of vassal status", that was a vindication for China. Indeed, the Frenchman's attack could be printed, without alteration, in the Peoples Daily, a mouthpiece of China's Communist Party. For all that, at least to date, the Chinese official response has been a study in caution, avoiding loud expressions of solidarity with France. That is revealing, because China normally praises French leaders when they call for Europe to pursue "strategic autonomy" in its foreign and security policies. Chinese diplomats know that France's vision of autonomy is code for avoiding over-reliance on America.
Instead, China has so far pursued narrower, rather technical lines of attack on aukus, related to the eight nuclear-propelled submarines that Australia is to buy from America. China's ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear watchdog, accused America of undermining non-proliferation work by transferring nuclear know-how and weapons-grade uranium to Australia, saying this would make it harder to stop Iran and North Korea from seeking similar technologies. The foreign ministry in Beijing added some tut-tutting about countries forming small cliques. By the standards of recent America-bashing in China, such grumbles barely count as throat-clearing.
After speaking to various wise owls in Beijing, both Chinese and foreign, Chaguan has explanations to offer. It is true that aukus confirms prejudices dear to Chinese officials and scholars. The first of these is that power is the driver of geopolitics, even if smaller countries talk of putting their faith in multinational cooperation, the rules-based order and other pretty phrases. If Australia would rather be America's vassal than France's partner, that merely confirms China's bleak, might-makes-right worldview. That view is reflected in lectures that China delivers to envoys in Beijing. With tiresome regularity, it is the lot of Western ambassadors to be informed that, if their small or midsized home country has dared to challenge China, it can only be because their government is foolishly trying to please America, whose hand is behind all of China's troubles.
The aukus pact also reinforces a talking point that the Western world is far from united about China, especially when it comes to speaking out about questions of principle, such as the crushing of Hong Kong's democratic opposition or the repression of Muslims in Xinjiang. These are mostly Anglo-Saxon obsessions, Chinese diplomats and scholars like to suggest. Alas, they sigh, Americans, the British and their friends in the Anglosphere think it is their birthright to run the world, like some gang of finger-wagging missionaries or sunburnt colonial administrators. Chinese officials praise leaders whom they see as more focused on business interests, such as Angela Merkel in Germany.
Still, China has not hastened to woo France in its hour of wrath. For one thing, China may see a benefit in letting Western powers feud, uninterrupted. For another, France's furious response is a bit undignified. In Chinese culture, a public tantrum may signal nao xiucheng nu, or "from shame to rage", meaning the specific form of high-decibel meltdown staged by someone facing humiliation. Ticking off reasons why France might be cross, a Chinese scholar lists the cancelled contract worth tens of billions of dollars, and a "loss of face" caused by Australia's hint that French submarines are not capable enough to deter China.
Nor is aukus hailed as a chance to divide the West. Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University in Beijing, notes China's relatively weak anti-submarine capabilities. "For Australia to have nuclear submarines is very dangerous for China," he says. "They are not needed for Australia's national defence. This is about China."
An arms race looms
Chinese leaders have a double view of America. They remain exceedingly wary of American areas of strength, from its armed forces to its high technology. Chinese leaders can see for themselves America's robust economic growth, compared with Europe or Japan. Yet they increasingly believe that Western societies are growing decadent. "The key competition between China and the us is about domestic governance," explains Professor Wang, before listing America's failings, from economic and racial inequalities to its handling of covid-19. "In the view of the Chinese ruling elite, us domestic governance is in serious trouble," he says.
In Beijing it is seen as enraging that this failing ex-hegemon remains strong enough to defy or dream of containing China. Mr Biden is called a weak, transitional figure. Chinese diplomats have treated his envoys, including his secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, and climate envoy, John Kerry, with studied belligerence. Under President Xi Jinping, a stern autocrat, China is impatient with being criticised. It rejects Mr Biden's assertion that the relationship can be at once sharply competitive and co-operative when needed. Above all, China is sure that America is trying to create alliances to stop its rise. A cautious initial reaction to aukus should not be misread. Discretion is not the same as calm.

[...]Qianlong was a member of the Manchu nationality, like all Qing emperors. [...]to the security-obsessed hard men who run China, pacifying restive regions is a supremely patriotic act.

全文文献: Headnote A Qing dynasty ruler is praised for pacifying China's borderlands
What with his dozens of concubines, his obsession with collecting precious jade and his penchant for inscribing his own (not very good) poems onto ancient paintings, the Qianlong emperor makes an unlikely hero for the Communist Party of China, especially one led by Xi Jinping, a stern ascetic. Qianlong was a man of formidable intellect and will, whose long reign from 173695 marked a high point of the Qing dynasty. But he was also a conservative aristocrat, from his passion for genealogy to his love of bowhunting on horseback, an archaic pastime even then.
Chaguan was surprised, then, to hear an official historian praise Qianlong in terms that would make a Politburo member blush. The scholar, Wang Xudong, heads the Palace Museum in Beijing, as the Forbidden City is formally known. During a government-organised press tour, Mr Wang described past emperors as hard-working statesmen who "wanted their empire to be stable and prosperous". Unbidden, Mr Wang denied that the geomantic design of the Forbidden City, with a hill behind it and a river in front, is a form of superstition. Feng shui is a commonsense tradition, he argued: everyone wants shelter from the wind and sustaining water nearby. As for palace temples devoted to ancestor worship, "China is a country devoted to families," he soothed, as if duty-bound to play down any contradiction between imperial wonders and modern-day rule by an atheist party. Your columnist asked about two wildly popular drama series set in Qianlong's court, which were booted from state television channels in 2019 after official media grumbled about the "negative impact" of imperial sagas filled with poisonings, betrayals and extravagant living. Such so-called Qing dramas are "cultural pollution", sniffed Mr Wang. Why can't they show examples of good governance by the emperor, or that princes and princesses were diligent and studious, he asked? "Those are lessons that our children can learn."
Tributes to favoured emperors are not new. As the party replaced Maoist fervour with Chinese nationalism in the 1980s and 1990s, Qianlong was rehabilitated as a nation-builder. Through a mix of diplomacy, wars and campaigns to crush far-flung rebellions, Qianlong added vast territories to his empire, notably in Tibet and Xinjiang. His reign was declared a heyday of the Qing dynasty before-as textbooks put it-the empire declined into decadence, subjected China to a century of humiliations at the hands of foreign powers, and collapsed in 1912. Recalling past shames remains useful for official historians, who praise the party for making China strong at last. But accounts of late-Qing weakness are increasingly offset by tributes to earlier glories. Today's party sees value in presenting itself as heir to a uniquely wise-and distinctively Chinese-civilisation that can be traced back 5,000 years. For Mr Wang, an official of vice-ministerial rank, the Forbidden City is proof, in timber and stone, of that cultural exceptionalism. "If you did not have 5,000 years of civilisation, you would not have socialism with Chinese characteristics," he declared, calling the party "a loyal inheritor and protector" of that glorious past.
On August 24th Mr Xi, the party's supreme leader, visited a site dear to Qianlong, an imperial summer retreat at Chengde, in cool, wooded hills north of Beijing. Mr Xi toured Puning Temple, a Buddhist complex built in a mix of Tibetan and Han Chinese styles. That architecture celebrates Qianlong's crushing of a revolt by Mongol nomads who practised Tibetan Buddhism. Inspecting Puning's red-pillared halls, Mr Xi stressed one of his priorities, the need to "sinicise" religions, meaning to make them Chinese in orientation so that, in his words, they better conform to and serve the needs of a socialist society. Then Mr Xi explored a new exhibition at the Chengde Museum that praises Qianlong in language that could come straight from the People's Daily. Museum signs explain that Qianlong "improved the Qing central government's management of Tibet, quelled multiple bouts of conflict by separatists in Xinjiang, and further unified this multi-ethnic country".
Chaguan visited the museum a few days later. It presents Qianlong as the epitome of a virtuous, Chinese ruler, whether that meant honouring ancestral rites by holding autumn hunts, or introducing policies to "unify all ethnicities". There are reproductions of his Mandarin-language calligraphy and images of him in Chinese imperial robes. In fact Qianlong was a member of the Manchu nationality, like all Qing emperors. The Qing won the throne by toppling a Chinese dynasty, the Ming. Qianlong intended his hunt to preserve the traditions of his martial, nomadic ancestors, calling it "the best way to train Manchus". It was open to Manchu nobles and soldiers, and some Mongol allies. Like many sacred Qing institutions, the hunt was essentially closed to the Han, the majority Chinese nationality. Han Chinese lived as subjects in a Manchu-led empire, barred by law from marrying Manchus and often living in separate city districts.
Rebranding the multi-ethnic Manchu empire as "China"
Such ethnic divisions and hierarchies complicate boasts about 5,000 years of continuous Chinese civilisation. Official historians respond by claiming that the Qing so admired Han culture that they instantly assimilated into it, becoming the latest in an unbroken line of Chinese rulers. Manchu-language imperial archives make clear that is too neat: the Qing retained a hybrid identity.
The exhibit in Chengde is a puzzle. Important enough to draw Mr Xi, it rests on easily debunked history. The solution lies in another wall sign, which praises Chengde as a monument to the Qing dynasty's "historic feats" of "pacification and consolidation of the border regions". Two intensely political ideas lurk in that scholarly statement. First, the term "consolidation" reflects the party's claim that Tibet and Xinjiang have always been Chinese and so were reclaimed, not conquered, by the Qing. Second, to the security-obsessed hard men who run China, pacifying restive regions is a supremely patriotic act. That makes Qianlong a model worker.

全文文献: Headnote A new book lifts the curtain on anti-corruption campaigns to reveal an untouchable elite
The call from China came in the early morning. Desmond Shum, a former tycoon now living in the West, heard the voice of his ex-wife, Duan Weihong, for the first time in four years. Ms Duan vanished in Beijing in September 2017, shortly after Communist Party anti-corruption investigators came for a patron of hers, a young member of the Politburo once seen as a successor to the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping.
The call from Ms Duan, who also used the English name Whitney, was followed quickly by a second. Both contained a warning. She urged her ex-husband to halt the publication, on September 7th, of a book he has written about their joint career as entrepreneurs in the 1990s and 2000s. That was a gilded age of breakneck growth and influence-peddling that, Mr Shum alleges, vastly enriched both the couple and their business partners, including family members of senior leaders within the Communist Party. "No good comes to those who oppose the state," Ms Duan told her ex-husband, saying that she was on a provisional form of release but faced renewed detention at any time. She begged him to consider the welfare of their 12-year-old son, who lives with Mr Shum.
He published anyway. "I don't know whether I was talking to her, or to her handlers," Mr Shum says in a telephone interview. "She told me herself that she has had no contact with the outside world for the past four years." Weighing this attempt at intimidation, he is unsure whether the party knew what was in his book, or simply feared "who I am and what I know".
The machine was right to be worried. Large scandals of the recent past are revisited in "Red Roulette: An Insider's Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption and Vengeance in Today's China", including allegations that the family of Wen Jiabao, then the prime minister, amassed vast fortunes by facilitating business deals and taking stakes in state-owned firms on strikingly generous terms. Some of those deals were brokered by Mr Shum and his ex-wife, though he denies law-breaking. Small, grubby details of elite life in the book are just as revealing, for they challenge one of the party's main claims to legitimacy, namely that its monopoly on power helps to explain China's modern-day rise.
In the party's telling, its autocracy is a merit-based system run by technocrats who are free to take the long view and act for the common good, rather than worrying about the next election. Mr Shum describes the reality. To build a new airport cargo terminal, he spent three years collecting 150 official seals from sundry agencies and ministries, many of them locked in paralysing competition with one another. That quest involved, at various points, arranging heart-bypass surgery for a local official who collapsed during a junket to Las Vegas and California, and building airportcustoms officers a new complex, complete with tennis courts and a 200-seat theatre.
Mr Shum names the hotel in Beijing where, on any given night, three or four government ministers were hosted by entrepreneurs eager to buy their favour, in a labyrinth of private dining rooms designed to keep different groups from spotting each other. His book turns a jaundiced, insider's eye on claims that, in the absence of a free press, independent judiciary and other checks and balances, officials are held to account by internal targets. Explaining the purging of a big airports boss, Mr Shum concedes that the official's gambling habit made him vulnerable, but insists that his cardinal error was to exceed revenue targets by such a margin that rival bureaucrats craved his job.
In some aspects, Mr Shum's book supports Mr Xi's diagnosis of China's ills. It describes sleaze that largely predates Mr Xi's elevation as party chief in 2012. Since then, the Xi era has witnessed an anti-corruption drive that has seen more than 1.5m officials punished. Mr Xi himself grumbles about foot-dragging officials who put parochial interests first.
Still, leaders have grounds to dislike the book. It argues that Mr Xi's anti-corruption drive is as much a campaign to consolidate power as a sincere attempt to reform a rotten system. The campaign has spared some notoriously corrupt princelings, the children or grandchildren of high officials. A self-made man, Mr Shum calls red aristocrats a "separate species", reared in highwalled compounds, sent to special schools and fattened on food supplies reserved for senior leaders.
They even enjoy special forms of corruption, he notes. Rather than hustle to build real businesses, he describes princelings seeking lucrative monopoly contracts from the state. Most damningly, he charges that the well-born are shielded during anti-corruption probes, in part because they know to obey what he calls the party's Mafia-like code of silence. He asserts that Li Peiying, the airports boss, was executed after talking too much about highlevel corruption, while in the same year a party elder's son was only jailed for taking larger bribes. "Red aristocrats got a prison sentence; commoners got a bullet in the head," he writes.
Now you've crossed the line
With that charge, the book challenges a second form of legitimacy that is dear to Mr Xi, himself the son of a high-ranking official. Mr Xi asks the masses to have faith in the party, not just because China is more prosperous, but because it carries "red genes" inherited from revolutionary pioneers and martyrs, and has always put the people first. In a speech on July 1st Mr Xi declared: "The party has no special interests of its own-it has never represented any individual interest group, power group, or privileged stratum."
"Red Roulette" undercuts that claim. It describes red aristocrats demanding 30% stakes in business deals merely for being seen to be supportive. It details an elite China built on secrets and fear, in which family ties are one of the only reliable bonds of trust. Mr Xi would have people believe that corruption is an external infection. Insiders know that it is in the party's blood.

全文文献: Headnote China rolls out new textbooks on its supreme leader's philosophy
Ask members of China's elite-from senior officials to academics at leading universities, well-known commentators or bosses at big companies-to explain the beliefs of the country's leader, Xi Jinping, and their replies are surprisingly unhelpful. Even simple questions elicit waffly answers. Take an ongoing campaign to clip the wings of some of China's largest firms, notably technology giants. The authorities have variously accused such businesses of seeking excessive profits, harming national security with a cavalier approach to data, abusing workers, bullying smaller firms or exploiting young consumers with addictive video games and online fan clubs. Is Mr Xi revealing himself as an ideologue, bent on re-imposing Communist Party control over the economy at the expense of growth? Or is he more pragmatic than that: a nationalist strongman who is helping to make China stable at home and mighty abroad? There is chatter among the country's grandees, but no consensus.
Given such confusion among grown-ups, this is a bold moment to issue a new series of textbooks to all students in Chinese schools, colleges and universities, with the aim of explaining Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era, as Mr Xi's political philosophy is formally known.
As the academic year began on September 1st, teachers and lecturers began distributing these books, tailored for each age-group, down to children as young as six. The use of stand-alone schoolbooks devoted to a serving leader marks a break with decades of caution. The last time that hundreds of millions of youngsters clutched books devoted to the wisdom of one man was under Mao Zedong, the object (and instigator) of a disastrous personality cult.
Books for the young are especially revealing, for they have to keep their messages simple. Primary schools have long taught the general rudiments of ideology. Via courses with names like "ethics and law", children have studied good deeds by the party's founders and modern-day leaders. They have contemplated the magnificence of the motherland (helped by copious images of wind farms and border-marker stones). Textbooks have devoted many pages to wholesome lessons about honesty, friendship, the importance of hand-washing and respect for elders.
The latest books for primary schools are still wholesome. But they are more focused on defining citizenship as a relationship with the party and its leader. Official guides for teachers concede that it is challenging for very young students to grasp abstract concepts. As a result, the new textbooks will use "golden" maxims from Mr Xi, as well as vivid stories and emotional experiences to "plant the seeds of love for the party, love for the nation and love for socialism in their little hearts". A notice issued in late August by the education ministry's National Textbook Committee sets out further aims. Youngsters should be guided to understand that Mr Xi is the leader of the whole party and country, it says. They must also resolve to obey and follow the party from their earliest years.
In addition to praising conformity, the new books offer homely warnings about those who fail to fit in. The last chapter of the new textbook for six- to eight-year-olds opens with an injunction to "Button the First Button of Life Correctly". Mr Xi often uses this phrase in speeches to the young. It refers to what he calls the duty of schools and families "to teach the first lessons of life well", so that children do not end up out of line with their peers, like a misbuttoned coat that will have to be adjusted later.
Another lesson in the book tells children about "Grandpa Xi's expectations of us". Alongside images of Mr Xi with members of the Young Pioneers, a party organisation for children aged between six and 14, it informs pupils: "As paramount leader of the party and state, Grandpa Xi Jinping has always cared for us, and wishes for us to strive to grow into worthy builders and inheritors of socialism." In practice, teachers of politics and ideology-who form a highly trained elite, and a pool for future school heads-are encouraged to leaven this stodge with singing contests or lessons in patriotism based on news stories. Teachers say that instructive recent events include last year's border clash between Chinese and Indian troops, and the American export bans on components needed by Huawei, a Chinese electronics giant.
Power is the point
At first glance these textbooks for small children, filled with Mr Xi's quotes about caring for the environment, and with songs such as "I Love You, China", (sample lyrics: "I love your boundless forest, I love your towering mountains") may not seem to settle hard questions about the country's ruling philosophy. Arguably, though, Chinese youngsters are getting something close to the true essence of Xi Jinping Thought. The overall aim of this reform, the textbook committee explains, is for the school and university curriculum to "comprehensively introduce" Mr Xi's views on economics, politics, the rule of law, science and technology, culture, education, ethnic policies, religion, national defence, ecological civilisation, party-building and diplomacy, among other subjects. Put more concisely, Mr Xi is to be seen as the undisputed authority on everything.
This is not the same as a Maoist personality cult. Mao encouraged the young to attack their teachers. He egged on fanatical Red Guards as they destroyed ancient temples. He wanted followers to attack a party establishment whose revolutionary fervour and loyalty he had come to doubt. In contrast, Mr Xi wants the young to study diligently, to take regular exercise and to listen to teachers talk about 5,000 years of glorious Chinese culture. Mr Xi is the establishment: the supreme incarnation of party authority. The party's legitimacy, in turn, rests on its claims to unrivalled competence and success. It is not for ordinary citizens to second-guess or debate what Mr Xi personally believes. Like children heeding a teacher or an elder, it is their role to obey. *

摘要: State media suggest that China may soon suspend direct rail-freight services to Lithuania, then sever other economic links with that country of 2.8m people (Lithuanian farmers should forget long-held dreams of selling milk to China, it is hinted). China routinely freezes trade talks and official visits whenever foreign leaders meet Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (Lithuania suffered this fate in 2013). A few months later Chinese-speaking visitors proudly filmed themselves vandalising signs of support for Hong Kong planted on the Hill of Crosses, a shrine to national independence dating to Lithuania's occupation by Nazi Germany and then by the Soviet Union.

全文文献: Headnote Nationalist outrage has often served China well, but that may be changing
China has an anger-management problem, at least when dealing with small and mid-size Western democracies. The fate of Lithuania, a European Union member on the shores of the Baltic Sea, is a case in point.
The country is being punished for agreeing that Taiwan, a democratic island that China claims as its own territory, may open a "Taiwanese Representative Office" in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital. China calls that an affront to its sovereignty. It has summoned its ambassador, Shen Zhifei, home for consultations, and told Lithuania to recall its envoy, Diana Mickeviciene. In a covid-era twist, China informed Ms Mickeviciene of her fate as she returned to Beijing from a summer break. She has to complete three weeks of strict quarantine at her residence and, after emerging on August 31st, catch the next flight home. State media suggest that China may soon suspend direct rail-freight services to Lithuania, then sever other economic links with that country of 2.8m people (Lithuanian farmers should forget long-held dreams of selling milk to China, it is hinted). In a detail noted with dismay by foreign envoys in Beijing, Lithuania's embassy has received a barrage of threatening calls, many targeting local Chinese staff.
China's problem is not simply that it has a short fuse. It is not new for leaders in Beijing to downgrade relations with governments that cross their "red lines". China routinely freezes trade talks and official visits whenever foreign leaders meet Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (Lithuania suffered this fate in 2013). Last year China curbed imports of coal and wine from Australia after that country's government called for an international probe into covid-19's origins. Often, China's demands are arcane as well as aggressive. Lithuania may earn a partial reprieve if it permits only a "Taipei Representative Office" in Vilnius. China tolerates trade offices named after Taiwan's capital, because those sound like local government outposts. Even the hair-trigger anger of the Chinese public-or at least its noisiest elements-is wearily familiar. Each week, it seems, online nationalists demand a new domestic boycott of a business, or the cancellation of a foreign or local celebrity accused of hurting Chinese pride. Threats directed at Chinese deemed "race traitors" are alarmingly common.
Rather, Chinese irascibility may prove more problematic than before because China's ambitions are changing. The country no longer inhabits a world of bilateral ties dominated by trade, of the sort that allowed it to play one country off against another. It hopes to create new international networks and groupings that share similar views about what constitutes good governance, in which China plays the central role. That brings new forms of scrutiny when it loses its temper.
About a decade ago, lots of foreign countries saw China as a dazzling, potentially transformative economic partner. Lithuania was no exception. In competition with Estonia and Latvia, its Baltic neighbours, it pitched its largest airport as a hub for Chinese flights, and its main seaport, Klaipeda, as an entry-point for Chinese ships. More recently, it sought to be a European gateway for Chinese financial technologies. In 2012 Lithuania joined 15 other central and eastern European countries, nine of them eu members, in a Chinese-led grouping. This came to be known as the "16 plus one" initiative, holding annual summits with China's prime minister and spawning countless committees to work on co-operation. At first, many in eastern Europe chafed when the group was called a threat to the eu's unity by the continent's rich Westerners. Easterners particularly resented being chided by Germany, given that country's exceptional access to Chinese leaders and markets.
Disappointment followed. Chinese investments in central and eastern Europe proved paltry, and the lion's share went to Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland and Serbia. Trade increased, but mostly because of imports from China. Today, China is still only Lithuania's 12th-largest trade partner. As dreams of an economic bonanza faded, some members of the 16 plus one (which swelled to 17 after Greece joined in 2019) began comparing notes about the bloc's political aims and lack of transparency. Like-minded embassies discovered that Chinese officials and party bodies were making direct contacts with regions, cities and institutions in their home countries, bypassing national capitals. In February six members-Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia-sent only ministers to a virtual summit of the 17 plus one, though President Xi Jinping was in the chair.
China's brand of performative patriotism goes global
Further complicating China's image, its nationalist fervour is increasingly on display far from home. In August 2019 Lithuania accused China's embassy in Vilnius of rallying Chinese citizens to disrupt a protest in support of Hong Kong's democrats (Chinese diplomats were photographed handing out banners). A few months later Chinese-speaking visitors proudly filmed themselves vandalising signs of support for Hong Kong planted on the Hill of Crosses, a shrine to national independence dating to Lithuania's occupation by Nazi Germany and then by the Soviet Union. The videos went viral, appalling Lithuanians. In April this year expansion of Klaipeda's outer harbour was put on hold for at least a decade. Senior officials had earlier called China's attempts to invest in the port a national-security risk. In May Lithuania's foreign minister announced his country's withdrawal from the 17 plus one, calling it divisive and less efficient than a unified eu.
State media accuse Lithuania of foolishly provoking China in order to curry favour with America, as if smaller countries lack any will of their own. The mood of gloom and wariness among many European embassies in Beijing is obvious to all. But domestic political imperatives require outsize displays of anger, whenever China feels disrespected. That is a clumsy way to manage foreigners. To China, however, being defied is worse.

全文文献: Headnote The big win for China in Afghanistan is seeing America humbled
On the afternoon of August 17th, as scenes of horror unfolded around Kabul, China's envoy to Afghanistan recorded the tranquil mood at his own embassy. The ambassador's smartphone images, proudly shared on social media by Hu Xijin, the editor of a Communist Party tabloid, show the Chinese flag snapping crisply against a summer sky, and front doors guarded by nothing more menacing than a tall porcelain vase.
China's propaganda machine is enjoying the fall of Afghanistan, at least for now. Chinese diplomats and state media have missed no chance to contrast the chaotic retreat of America and its allies with their own country's continued welcome. For China, this is a chance to advance a model of foreign relations based on coldly weighed security and economic interests, rather than on lofty talk of building a better Afghanistan where girls may go to school. No bonds of affection or trust bind China and the Taliban. Instead, China has pursued a few narrowly defined goals during years of intensifying contacts with Taliban delegations. China's list is headed by its desire for a stable Afghanistan, especially near that country's short, mountainous border with China. Above all, China has made clear that in return for the international recognition that the Taliban crave, and (probably rather limited) investments in roads, mines and other infrastructure, they must deny any haven to exiles from China's north-western region of Xinjiang, especially Uyghurs. China's fear is that Uyghur militants, including some with combat experience in Syria or training in Iran, may hope to enter Xinjiang through Afghanistan. Though China's iron-fisted rule in Xinjiang-featuring the demolition of mosques and the detention of Muslims to "cure" them of excessive piety- offends all that the Taliban purport to believe, the group needs China's backing. Its political leader, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, duly told China's foreign minister on July 28th that the Taliban will never allow any force to use Afghan territory "to engage in acts detrimental to China".
For months China has been calling on the Taliban to join a government of national unity and embrace a moderate version of Islam. In briefings with foreign diplomats in Beijing, Chinese officials now concede that they cannot know whether the Taliban's promises to shun extremism will stick. But those same officials apply a favourite Chinese argument to Afghanistan's rapid regime change: namely, that rulers can earn a mandate through material success and shows of broad public support, even if they never hold elections that impress snooty Westerners. Afghanistan fell without much of a fight, Chinese diplomats say in private. That suggests the Taliban enjoy a measure of legitimacy.
Praising the Taliban to the Chinese public carries risks. For a few hours a social media post by the People's Daily, the party's flagship newspaper, tested the line that the Taliban are former students from refugee camps who gained power with the support of the poor. The post went viral, but not in a good way, promoting complaints from netizens at warm words for a group known for brutalising women and beheading people in public. First the post was deleted, then online references to it censored.
Scolding America is more popular. In a telephone call, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, advised the secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, to reflect on the lesson of Afghanistan: that a foreign model cannot be "arbitrarily" applied to a country with a very different history and culture. Though America and China share an interest in Afghan stability, Mr Wang hinted that Chinese help might not come free. He grumbled that the Biden administration cannot seek to "contain and suppress China" then turn round and "hope for China's co-operation". The foreign ministry's spokeswoman was still more scornful, calling America a destructive force that leaves "turbulence, division, broken families, deaths and other scars" wherever its troops tread.
State media boast that America is exposed as an unreliable ally. Special glee is reserved for the panic presumed to grip Taiwan, the democratic island that China claims as its own and that mainland leaders are sworn to invade, should it declare formal independence. Strikingly, when Taiwan's prime minister, Su Tseng-chang, was asked whether his government, if attacked, might collapse like Afghanistan's, he did not offer bluster about America showing up for sure. Instead, Mr Su drew another lesson from Afghanistan: that outsiders cannot save a country in internal disarray. Taiwan must believe it can defend itself, he told reporters in Taipei.
China, a reliably self-interested power
Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Centre for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, calls the blow to America's global reputation the big upside for China. Against that, Mr Zhu concedes that China dislikes uncertainty. What is more, some Chinese scholars worry that by leaving Afghanistan, America has freed resources to focus on the Asia-Pacific region. Overall, he argues against exaggerating his country's Afghan interests. Afghan chaos would be troublesome, but the Chinese border is not hard to lock down, and the West is the main target of Islamists, not China, he says. Mr Zhu scoffs at talk from Western analysts about Chinese ambitions to bind Afghanistan into its Belt and Road Initiative, a globe-spanning infrastructure scheme. "The economic gain would be small," he ventures, noting that the bri currently bypasses Afghanistan.
Chinese officials used to be defensive about their focus on economic development and stability. They asked others to respect China's version of universal values, adapted to the conditions of a large, poor country. Now, they challenge the very notion of valuesbased foreign policies. Those may sound benign, it is argued, but are really cover for Westernisation, a disastrous folly. China is ready for a post-American age, guided by cold realism. That is a polarising moral to draw from Afghanistan's agonies, that many in the West will find hard to welcome. These are polarising times. *

全文文献: Headnote Why China's rulers don't want their public to debate climate change
Even a short spell submerged in floodwaters is enough to transform a car into an eerie, unfamiliar object. A week after ferocious rains first battered the central province of Henan, the hulk of a white Toyota-fronds of waterweed wrapped round its buckled frame-lay on a muddy street in Mihe, a hard-hit riverside town, like a long-lost shipwreck. Just finding the car had taken several days, its owners explained. It had been carried two kilometres downstream by the Sishui river, storm-swollen into a murderous torrent many times its normal width.
Scores died in the floods across Henan province, some of them in subway trains and road tunnels that remained open long after meteorologists issued a red-alert warning of lethal weather. China's propaganda machine is on the defensive. It has cast this terrible human tragedy as a "sudden act of nature": an exceptional event that could not be planned for. State media have lined up scientists to describe how air filled with water vapour by a summer typhoon was concentrated and forced upwards by two mountain ranges. It dumped a year's worth of rain in four days over flat plains crossed by several rivers, at one point dropping over 200mm of rain on the city of Zhengzhou in a single hour.
Alongside technical talk about the storm's rarity, officials have stressed how it fits into China's long history of summer floods. Nodding to the centuries-old tradition that successful flood control is a mark of virtuous rule, Communist Party newspapers have praised "important instructions" on disaster prevention and relief issued by the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping. Television has filled with images of soldiers shoring up dykes, people being rescued in small boats, and party members organising patriotic volunteers. At least in the main party and government-run news outlets, one possible cause of the rains has been hardly discussed at all: climate change. All summer, extreme weather has sparked loud public debate from Canada to Germany and Japan about whether a climate emergency has begun. Not in China.
Talking to locals in Mihe on a recent weekday, Chaguan met many who called the floods a one-off event. The fatalists included the young couple who owned that shipwrecked Toyota Corolla, encountered as they fished in its waterlogged interior for valuables. There is no reason to think such a disaster will strike again, said the young man, examining a weed-covered set of keys and a bank card. It was "a once-in-a-i,ooo-year rainstorm", he declared. That same phrase came up time and again in Mihe, reflecting its prominence in approved accounts of the deluge.
Yet in China, public opinion is seldom quite as constrained by the official line as it first appears. Asked whether the weather had changed in their lifetimes, several locals said that it had. They described summers that have grown hotter, and the vanishing of heavy winter snows. Some linked those changes to the storm that had just smashed through their town, reducing bridges to jumbled slabs of concrete. Locals said they dared not talk to a foreign reporter about how many died in the floods in or around Mihe, in case they said something forbidden. But a few volunteered that the government needed to do more to tackle climate change. "This weather nowadays, nobody can navigate it," said a man who sells plastic-cloth rain covers for cars.
If opinion in Mihe is not monolithic, it is distinctively Chinese. Those calling for climate action often went on to describe largescale engineering works, of the sort dear to party bosses. A shopkeeper drying mud-encrusted stock in the sun suggested that the Sishui's channel needed widening. "The river is too narrow, the water could not drain away fast enough," he ventured. Others, when asked about the climate, replied with praise for the government for cleaning up air pollution in Mihe, notably by closing a dirty local coal mine. "The environment now is much better than in the past," said a young man riding on a forklift-truck with his grandfather, a wrecked micro-car balanced on its prongs.
What could not be heard in Mihe were calls for citizens' campaigns to lobby the government. "This is a one-party state," explained a local, flatly. Asked about young people's views of the climate, a teenager suggested that in China, individuals do not believe that their actions will affect the environment at large.
It is no surprise that official media are not rushing to explore connections between extreme weather and climate change, says Li Shuo, a policy expert at Greenpeace, a campaign group. The media's job is to mobilise public opinion, and Chinese leaders do not expect the people to drive climate policy. Nor do they welcome pressure, including from natural disasters, to alter their carefully laid plans. "They don't have much tolerance of any external event setting their agenda," says Mr Li.
Change in China must come from within
Outsiders may be tempted to shrug at China's relative lack of grassroots debate. After all, Mr Xi has promised that Chinese carbon emissions will peak in 2030, then decline to net zero by 2060, and his word is final. Top-down policies are already seeing solar panels and wind farms installed at a prodigious rate.
In fact, outsiders should hope for more debate at China's grassroots. The country's climate plans, though bold on paper, are not urgent enough. The world needs Chinese carbon emissions to peak years earlier than 2030 to avoid catastrophic warming. China cannot safely continue to invest in new coal-fired power plants at home or abroad. Alas, growing resentment of America and the West means that international pressure has an ever-smaller effect. In contrast, when the Chinese public grows really impatient, leaders pay heed, as when they cleaned up smog-choked skies over Beijing and other big cities. In the face of crushing losses, the resilience and grit of Mihe's residents is something to behold. If allowed a more informed debate about why disaster struck, some of that same energy might just help to save the world. *

摘要: [...]though open discussion of this question is taboo, the authorities are being oddly secretive about how well Chinesemade vaccines work. [...]in May, eu regulators trying to inspect a vaccine production site near Beijing were stymied by Chinese officials who insisted that those busy scientists would have to spend three weeks in quarantine. (Ambassadors may quarantine at home for 21 days, but only if their residence is a detached house and they are driven there with a police escort.) In June Spain's consulate-general in Shanghai protested after a newly arrived Spanish citizen was made to sign documents that she could not read and undergo days of tests and mri scans in a clinic.

全文文献: Headnote Covid-19 fears are combining with rising nationalism to keep China closed.
It is becoming clear that China will not, or perhaps cannot, reopen its borders soon. The reasons are many. Chinese leaders have declared that zero tolerance of covid-19 is a mark of good government. Officials are fired if cases are found on their patch, so they lock down whole cities to crush even tiny outbreaks. Ordinary Chinese associate the virus with fear and stigma, knowing that a single infected person may force thousands of neighbours, colleagues or classmates into quarantine.
The outside world stands for chaos. Propaganda outlets stress that new cases involve arrivals from abroad. State media describe foreigners, notably Americans, as too selfish, science-scorning and obsessed with individual rights to control the virus. Images of mask-less Westerners on crowded beaches or rampaging at antilockdown protests are a staple of Chinese news coverage. Lots of Chinese are cross about a lack of overseas praise for their country's strict approach. Their resentment is both sincere and stoked by propaganda that accuses American leaders of slandering China to cover up their cruel incompetence and 600,000 pandemic deaths.
Finally, though open discussion of this question is taboo, the authorities are being oddly secretive about how well Chinesemade vaccines work. Locally made jabs have been given to twofifths of the population, with assurances that they are highly effective. But few data have been released about how Chinese vaccines cope with variants, or how long they work. This opacity is a problem. Many developing countries have relied heavily on Chinese shots. Indonesia and Thailand are among those now planning booster jabs with Western vaccines, at least for medical workers.
Chinese officials grumble that America and the European Union have yet to approve a vaccine from China. But in May, eu regulators trying to inspect a vaccine production site near Beijing were stymied by Chinese officials who insisted that those busy scientists would have to spend three weeks in quarantine. The government rejected an offer for them to fly in by charter plane for a brief inspection visit in protective suits.
Meanwhile, mainland China has yet to approve any foreign vaccines, including the most effective ones that use mRNA gene technology. Perhaps China wants to protect domestic drugmakers from competition, suggest foreign diplomats. Equally, China may want to buy time for a locally made mRNA vaccine that is known to be in development. Given all these factors, it is not obvious how China will start to re-open, especially before some big events have safely passed. These include the Winter Olympics that Beijing will host next February and a Communist Party congress in late 2022, at which Xi Jinping is set to seek a fresh term as supreme leader.
For their part, foreigners who live in mainland China appreciate being in a country that has the virus under control: in spring 2020 hundreds of millions of Chinese spent weeks at home to break the chain of transmission, often without pay. But quite a few have also had enough. Surveys by the American and European chambers of commerce suggested the number of foreign residents in China had fallen by 30% in 18 months. International schools are braced for a fresh exodus this summer, it is said, including of teachers who have not seen families outside China for more than a year. This spring several embassies debated whether China should become a hardship posting reserved for diplomats without dependents. Their concerns include rules obliging all international arrivals, including children, to quarantine in a hotel for three weeks, and to enter an isolation clinic if they test positive. (Ambassadors may quarantine at home for 21 days, but only if their residence is a detached house and they are driven there with a police escort.)
In June Spain's consulate-general in Shanghai protested after a newly arrived Spanish citizen was made to sign documents that she could not read and undergo days of tests and mri scans in a clinic. The Spaniard had apparently tested positive for antibodies, either as a result of having been vaccinated or after recovering from a bout of covid-19. Chinese officials declined to explain.
Foreign companies in favoured sectors can secure visas for executives, or for engineers who are needed to build advanced manufacturing sites that China wants. But even the largest such businesses struggle to obtain visas for the families of their expatriate staff. As many as half a million foreign students at Chinese institutions are stuck outside the country: their visas were cancelled in March 2020. Let them study online, Chinese officials tell diplomats who mention their plight. International tourism, both inbound and outbound, has ground to a halt.
China now issues a few visas for temporary business and family visits. But any further opening provokes nervousness. The southern province of Guangdong, hit by a recent virus outbreak, is building a quarantine clinic for international arrivals with 5,000 beds. Those foreign airlines allowed to operate limited flights into China are often running at 10% of pre-pandemic capacity. Visits by political leaders from abroad have largely ceased. Some foreign ministers have been admitted to China to meet their counterpart, Wang Yi, but only in provincial cities. Beijing, where top leaders live, is off limits. Mr Xi attends overseas summits by video-link.
China wants foreign know-how and respect, not foreigners
Chinese history has seen many cycles of opening and turning inward. Anecdote by anecdote, evidence is mounting that foreigners, whether suspected of bearing dangerous germs or ideas, are becoming less welcome. On a recent domestic flight, Chaguan's neighbour pointedly asked to move seats. It is growing more common to face demands from members of the public to agree that China is strong and the West failing. Nationalism and impatience with foreign criticism were on the rise before covid-19. The pandemic has sped up those trends-as it has inspired at times nasty anti-Chinese racism abroad. Mutual distrust will be hard to overcome until China re-opens. That may take a while.

全文文献: Headnote A trip to Xinjiang reveals the racial targeting of population-control measures
When confronted with uncomfortable facts, China's usual response comes in two parts. First it tries denial and obfuscation. Should that not work, officials attack the motives of foreign critics. Arguments over Xinjiang, a far-western region that China runs with an iron fist, have reached this dangerous stage.
In recent months America, Britain, Canada and European Union countries, among others, have voiced concerns about Xinjiang. They point to evidence that China has detained perhaps a million Muslims in re-education camps, notably from the 11.6mstrong Uyghur population, imposed sterilisations on ethnic minority women and forced villagers into factory labour. Chinese diplomats call such Western charges a shameless plot to slander China and frustrate its rise. State media hurl ad hominem slurs at foreign researchers who scour government documents, satellite images and open-source materials to expose abuses in Xinjiang, describing them as anti-China zealots or cia agents. Chinese officials claim that Uyghur exiles who speak to foreign parliaments and news outlets are terrorists, or actors paid to tell lies.
Such smears, though wild, have an impact. Behind closed doors in Beijing, it is not hard to hear Western diplomats and business types grumbling that rows over Uyghurs are disrupting trade deals and climate co-operation with China. Some mutter that reports from Xinjiang are surely exaggerated. It is increasingly easy to meet Chinese who treat foreign concern for the Uyghurs as a cynical attack on their country. On a recent reporting trip to Xinjiang, it was no surprise to be registered by police several times a day, and to be followed by plain-clothes agents in cars, on foot and on bicycles. For foreign journalists, such scrutiny there is routine. It was more startling, and revealing, to be asked "Do you like China?" by an official who had just escorted Chaguan off a packed train, ostensibly for covid-19 checks.
Your columnist is not ready to abandon the notion that China and the West can agree on shared facts, even if they disagree on important principles. This Xinjiang trip was an experiment. The aim was to test the claim that Uyghurs are the targets of racist social engineering, using only government documents and interviews with officials and settlers from the country's Han Chinese majority, who cannot easily be accused of anti-China sentiment.
Three places were visited. Bachu, a county of cotton fields and fruit farms, is almost wholly Uyghur. Like many majority-Muslim areas in southern Xinjiang, it saw high birth rates not long ago. The county government reported a natural population growth rate in 2014 of almost 13 per thousand people. Using mortality rates for the surrounding prefecture, Kashgar, that figure equates to a birth rate of nearly 19 per thousand people. That is compatible with the average woman having perhaps three or four children during her reproductive years. Rural Uyghurs were allowed three children back then, and officials tolerated extra births to buy social peace.
At a weekday lunchtime, the results of that fertility boom could be seen in Bachu's main town. Watched by armed police-for the county saw deadly ethnic violence as recently as 2014-a sea of Uyghur children spilled out of primary and middle schools in uniform tracksuits and the red scarves of Young Pioneers. Passing stalls grilling meat and flatbread over charcoal, they greeted a foreign reporter in heavily accented Mandarin.
Those same cheerful crowds alarm Chinese scholars. They write of young Uyghur populations exhausting southern Xinjiang's water supplies, straining job markets and threatening stability in a border region. In 2017 Communist Party leaders ordered a campaign against illegal births, including cash rewards for locals who reported over-quota children. But legal births were also targeted. In January 2018 Bachu's government boasted of controlling the population's "excessive growth". By 2017 the county's birth rate had fallen from 19 to 13 per thousand, a highly unusual drop in just three years. Astonishingly, in 2019 Bachu reported a birth rate of 4.15 per thousand people. That is one of the lowest birth rates anywhere in the world, and a decline rarely seen even in wartime.
Li Xiaoxia, a government sociologist in Xinjiang, has called reports of forced sterilisations "slander". In an essay for state media in January she conceded that between 2017 and 2018, after the strict enforcement of rules, Xinjiang-wide births had fallen by 120,000 in a year. But Ms Li insisted that rural women from ethnic groups had "spontaneously" agreed to be sterilised. Some had taken rewards of 3,000 yuan ($460) or more for women willing to undergo tubal ligation before using their legal quota of children, she wrote. Others' minds had been freed by officials "from the shackles of religious extremism". She said Uyghurs and Han Chinese now followed the same rules, promoting "fewer and better" births.
Not all pregnancies are equal
Official documents tell a different story. Tiemenguan is a small town founded by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. The bingtuan, as this paramilitary enterprise is better known, was founded in 1954 to farm the region's barren plains and bring in Han Chinese settlers. Last year the town advertised for auxiliary police officers, seeking young candidates of Han nationality, and promising to cover 10,000 yuan of medical costs if they were to have a second child. Wang Jian, a statistician from the bingtuan's 6th division, is one of several scholars to recommend, in print, that the corps should encourage Han recruits to have more children, while limiting ethnic minority births. In a park in Shihezi, the largest bingtuan-run city, a father playing with two sons by a tree-shaded pond recalls how officials contacted him with a bonus for his youngest. A Han Chinese mother carrying her second child in her arms explains that his birth landed her a subsidy, extra leave and free milk powder. "They encourage you to have a second," she says. The double standard should be glaring to admirers and critics of China alike. Facts are stubborn things. *

全文文献: Headnote Until China burns less coal, foreign firms will be reluctant to invest more there
To hear china's Communist Party tell it, the nifty thing about autocracy is that it lets rulers plan for the long term. Apologists for one-party rule hail China's leaders as enlightened technocrats who think in centuries, while decadent Western democracies struggle to see beyond the next election cycle.
By the autocrats' logic, China should excel at tackling climate change. For it faces stark long-term risks. As an arid country that lacks clean water and productive farmland, and where the richest regions lie on the coast, China is exceedingly vulnerable to global warming and rising sea levels. Sure enough, the supreme leader, President Xi Jinping, seems to be taking charge. Last September he decreed that China's emissions of CO2 will peak by 2030 and that by 2060 the country will become carbon neutral. A China-wide emissions-trading system goes live this summer. Vast wind farms and arrays of solar panels have been built, and more are coming.
In fact, Chinese climate policy is a mess of contradictions. Perhaps time will show that Mr Xi is serious about making the unpopular, expensive changes that are needed to wean his country off fossil fuels, notably the coal that supplies nearly 60% of the country's energy. But it is difficult to be sure. China's coal consumption has risen significantly since it joined the Paris climate agreement in 2015. At home, a ban on new coal-fired power stations was lifted in 2018. The total capacity of such plants approved for construction or being built is larger than America's entire active coal-fired power sector. Overseas, despite pleas from America, the European Union and others, Chinese development banks lend billions of dollars each year to build coal-burning plants, though a stateowned giant, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, says it will phase out coal financing.
Provinces and cities, especially in the coal-reliant north-east, are hesitant about publishing carbon "peaking plans". They want more time to pursue growth before curbing greenhouse gases. The rules governing the emissions-trading scheme have been loosened so that only a handful of plants will face real constraints, at least initially. This reflects the leading role apparently granted to the main economic planning agency, at the expense of the environment ministry, in bodies charged with deciding how, and how fast, to tackle climate change. Some big steelmakers have been allowed to expand production again, months after they were caught breaking environmental rules and ordered to cut emissions.
Climate-related efforts in China are not always as mysterious or prone to sudden reversals. Take the China operations of foreign multinationals. Responding to consumers and politicians back home, many such firms have promised to make their global businesses carbon neutral, and to seek big cuts in emissions from their supply chains. As a result, the China bosses of some well-known European companies have told officials, including in the northeastern cities of Tianjin and Shenyang, that they will find it hard to expand or open new production sites if the electricity or heating on offer locally continues to come from coal. "In an energy-intensive industry, if the electricity is coal-based, you can't build a new plant," says Harald Kumpfert of the European Union Chamber of Commerce's branch in Shenyang, the capital of Liaoning province.
The largest taxpayer in Shenyang is a bmw joint venture that makes 600,000 cars a year at two plants. In 2016 the city had no green electricity to sell. Now a new wind farm in Liaoning-a blustery coastal province with huge potential for green energy-provides about two-thirds of BMW's power. More energy comes from solar panels built over car parks where vehicles await delivery. On a recent visit, Chaguan was shown technologies that have cut carbon emissions per vehicle by 84% since 2016, such as cleverly controlled ovens in the paint shop. In a nicely dramatic touch, freshly baked car bodies emerge on a raised conveyor that carries them on a bridge through an office building, on their way to assembly lines.
Alas, hundreds of bmw suppliers in China have "huge trouble" obtaining renewable electricity, say engineers at the car firm, suggesting that the foreigners have snapped up most green energy on offer. To avoid simply shuffling dirty energy around and to increase demand for renewables, energy-intensive Chinese suppliers, such as steelmakers or aluminium foundries, need to start installing efficient technologies and using low-carbon energy. Progress also requires changing the incentives that guide officials. bmw makes the case to governments that "jobs using renewable energy are sustainable jobs," says Johann Wieland, head of the carmaker's main China business.
Long-term plans, short-term incentives
China's political system, for all its multi-decade plans, is run by officials who may stay in a given job for five years, and whose next promotion depends on economic growth now. Zhang Lei, the chief executive of Envision, a big wind-energy and battery company, is confident that top-down orders can overcome local inertia. "The most important thing is that President Xi has made a huge commitment and continues to push that agenda," says Mr Zhang.
Ma Jun, an environmentalist, sees a role for pressure from above and below. He runs the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an influential Beijing-based organisation that tracks and publishes pollution and emissions data. "It is too much to expect a foreign company to change the energy mix of a city," says Mr Ma. But nudges from foreign and local businesses might push officials to a tipping point. "To change minds we need both marketbased and policy-based interventions," he says.
Multinational corporations are not saints. Many were happy to run profitable but dirty plants in faraway places. Too many are still reluctant to demand transparency from suppliers. But Western voters are growing serious about the climate, and about holding governments and businesses to account. That pressure might just be helpful in China. Pluralism is messy but potent stuff. *

摘要: Foreign firms pledged to build more resilient supply chains by diversifying into other countries, while noting that they would keep production sites "in China, for China", to serve Chinese demand when it returned. European companies report losing business opportunities because of laws that demand that sensitive technologies used in China must be secure and controllable by Chinese authorities. [...]firms enjoy red-carpet treatment: they are allowed to create Chinese subsidiaries which they own fully, helping them to protect trade secrets, and are spared red tape that entangles lesser rivals.

全文文献: Headnote Foreigners inside the Great Wall
Globalisation was meant to change China, but China is changing the world
Early last year, as covid-19 brought China to a near-halt for several weeks, multinational corporations caught a glimpse of a different kind of globalisation: one without a dynamic Chinese economy at its heart. Panic ensued.
Foreign businesses confessed that they had grown too dependent on China as the easiest and best place to make and sell their wares, whether for export or in domestic markets. The new virus, coming on top of a trade war with America, was declared a salutary shock that would drive big changes. Foreign firms pledged to build more resilient supply chains by diversifying into other countries, while noting that they would keep production sites "in China, for China", to serve Chinese demand when it returned.
A year on, the mood is very different. Nearly 600 companies responded to an annual survey of business confidence conducted by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, which was published on June 8th. They described surging optimism about China, with economic growth having resumed far more quickly than expected. Three-quarters of European firms said that they were profitable in China in 2020, allowing them to send revenues back to headquarters suffering from dismal results elsewhere.
Optimism varies by industry. In particular, makers of cars and luxury goods enjoyed bumper sales as affluent Chinese, denied holidays abroad by pandemic controls, went shopping instead. Fully 91% of the firms said they would maintain their investments in China, rather than move them elsewhere. Over a quarter of manufacturers are bringing supply chains more completely into China, five times as many as are moving them offshore.
Strikingly, however, the same companies remain as sceptical as before that China will open markets or enforce regulations in the same way for local and foreign firms. The same share as ever, one-sixth, report being compelled to transfer technologies in order to maintain market access. Two-fifths say that the business environment in China is more politicised than before. That share would surely have been higher had the survey been conducted after recent Chinese sanctions on European politicians and the whipping up by state media of consumer boycotts against h&m and other clothing brands, in response to European criticism of abuses in the far-western region of Xinjiang.
European companies report losing business opportunities because of laws that demand that sensitive technologies used in China must be secure and controllable by Chinese authorities. Those laws are buttressed by rules banning many data transfers across China's borders. That is forcing multinationals to build duplicate databases, cloud services and software systems just for China, and to hire all-Chinese research and development teams. Increasingly, says the eu chamber's president, Joerg Wuttke, firms must build one operation for China and another for the rest of the world.
A cynical Chinese official might listen to these businessfolk grumbling about how tough it is in China, and wonder why, exactly, China needs to heed foreign calls to reform, when the same people turn round and make new investments. Such an official might even observe that some important European businesses are responding to American export controls on sensitive technologies by moving factories out of America so that they can continue to cater to Chinese customers.
In private, European bosses concede that they have less and less leverage when trying to persuade China that it is in the country's self-interest to open up. Some are growing keener to use sticks against Chinese business in Europe, such as investmentscreening mechanisms or rules that would impose new costs on carbon-intensive projects or firms that are heavily subsidised by the Chinese state.
The China led by Xi Jinping is selective in its welcome to foreign firms. The most favoured sell things that China cannot make for itself, such as high-tech chemicals and industrial machinery, and whose presence attracts specialist suppliers. Such firms enjoy red-carpet treatment: they are allowed to create Chinese subsidiaries which they own fully, helping them to protect trade secrets, and are spared red tape that entangles lesser rivals. A lower tier of foreign firms makes products that Chinese consumers like, such as fancy European cars. The state tolerates their presence as long as they make those things in China, using Chinese workers and components, and pay local taxes. That can be profitable: some multinationals earn almost half their revenues in China. But that is because they are operating entirely within the Chinese wall. China is not especially important as a market for Western-made exports: the eu sells more to Britain than to China, for instance.
It is getting harder to bring foreign staff into China, particularly during the pandemic. Localising many jobs is a good idea: mediocre expatriates enjoyed unearned privileges for too long. But in a China steeped in angry nationalism, localisation also carries risks. Some Chinese executives take their government's side over stalled reforms, or over political issues like repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Others have a tin ear for politics in the West.
Putting the nation into multinational
Boards in the West used to worry about things like market feasibility studies. Now they must wrestle with a new, philosophical question: do their firms really want to operate in China as Chinese businesses, employing fewer and fewer foreigners, to generate revenues shared with global shareholders? If such outfits ask their home governments in the West for help, will it be forthcoming? Experienced executives describe bleak choices. "It is about the weighing of risks," says one. "The risks of not being here, with the risks of being here." Meanwhile, public opinion in the West is turning more hostile to a China seen as grimly dictatorial. Diversification does not make economic sense, it turns out. But politically the world is decoupling. That shock will have lasting effects. *

全文文献: Headnote A new children's film about Zhou Enlai reveals a lot about Xi Jinping's China
Countries have to make revealing choices as they craft patriotic messages for children. To put it kindly, young minds are tiny treasure-houses that deserve to be stocked with only a nation's most precious beliefs. To be more blunt, small children are easily distracted, so are best taught only a few important things.
It is therefore worth studying what China's propaganda chiefs have in store for youngsters this summer. As usual, June 1st was marked this year in China as International Children's Day, a festival of visits to museums, school picnics and wholesome games. A month later there will be a much larger event: celebrations on July 1st of the 100th anniversary of the party's founding in 1921.
China's leader, President Xi Jinping, is presented to the young as "Xi Dada", or "Uncle Xi", an austere but caring patriarch. Mr Xi stresses the importance of loyalty, which is why children's choirs are busy performing such songs as "Me and My Country" and "Follow the Leadership of the Communist Party of China". Party history is being used to inspire the masses. That explains reports of kindergarten pupils being dressed up in miniature combat fatigues and told to crawl on their bellies while clutching strawwrapped "rations", to re-enact Red Army supply runs. There is much talk of China entering a "new era" of prosperity, national strength and global influence. It is not hard, as a result, to find children's drawings on public display, showing high-speed trains and space rockets adorned with Chinese flags. The young are urged to be proud of ancient glories too, as heirs to what they are told is the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth.
This year's Children's Day saw the release of a new patriotic film made especially for children. It depicts the pre-teenage life of Zhou Enlai, who was China's prime minister from 1949 until his death from cancer in 1976. This brilliant, disappointing man is a puzzle for historians. To this day, many Chinese revere Zhou as a moderate who tempered Mao's worst excesses, especially during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. Too often, alas, the record shows Zhou enabling Mao's follies and failing to defend close allies from political attack. Born in 1898 into a once-grand family of scholar-officials, Zhou was a precocious student of the classics. But his childhood was blighted by the deaths of his mother and adoptive mother and by money woes that, at the age of 12, forced him to leave his birthplace, Huai'an, in the plains between the Yellow and Yangzi rivers, to seek a new life with an uncle in the north.
During the first decades of Communist rule, his privileged class background had to be explained away. A biography published in 1977, "The Early Life of Zhou Enlai" by Hu Hua, depicts Zhou as a "rebel against feudal society", who as a boy came to hate the gentry class into which he was born. Deepening poverty turned him into a "great proletarian revolutionary", it relates. That official history manages to praise Zhou's traditional education while reflecting the party's then-noisy disdain for pre-Communist codes of ethics, such as those taught by Confucius. Describing Zhou poring over books from his grandfather's library, Hu asserts that the boy was stirred by histories of "laudable national heroes" fighting foreign invaders, but was uninterested in Confucianism.
Biographies written in the 1990s by historians in the West, including Chae-Jin Lee, Barbara Barnouin and Yu Changgen, take a different view. They find that Zhou had a conventional Confucian education, which marked him for life. Nor do they agree that he was an angry rebel, noting his later, loving praise for his two mothers. Both were educated, tradition-minded daughters of scholarofficials. Indeed, they link Zhou's survival at Mao's side to a reverence for Confucian teachings about self-restraint and the need for officials to swallow small insults in the national interest.
The new film appears to agree. Chaguan watched "Zhou Enlai in his Childhood" on Children's Day in a cinema in Huai'an. The movie does not hide Zhou's ancestral wealth. It portrays him as a solemn little boy in a silk gown, visiting relatives in antique-filled mansions. Confucian customs are shown as expressions of love. The young Zhou kowtows to his elders and studies cobwebbed texts to make his dying mother proud. His adoptive mother teaches him to swallow an unjust punishment with tales of an ancient general who endured humiliations on his way to greatness.
The film is not fast-paced. There is much fidgeting in the cinema, though children perk up at a brief shot of a boy's bare bottom, and again when Zhou urges his adoptive mother to drink ink as a medicine. The Zhou family's struggles to afford a middle-class life are crafted to resonate with older cinema-goers. Zhou's father, a petty official in another town, is depicted as a migrant worker- largely absent, always fretting about money, and emotionally distant from his own son. The film shows health crises that wreck family finances and trigger rows about whether to spend money on medicine or school fees. Such dilemmas remain common today. The film's ending unites all ages. Over swelling chords, young Zhou waxes indignant on learning that Russia and Japan have taken territory from the ailing Chinese empire, then declares that he studies hard so that China may rise. That phrase of Zhou's is taught in schools to this day, and triggers murmurs of recognition.
Nationalism instead of class struggle
After the film, a mother in the audience, Lu Ye, calls it "very educational" to see the orphaned Zhou confront debt-collectors, endure hardships and assume responsibilities beyond his years. Ms Lu's 12-year-old son, Rongye, says that he "really liked" the film. He praises an episode in which Zhou picked and sold wild vegetables to help repay those debts, until his hands bled. "For the welfare of the family, he didn't care," Rongye notes approvingly.
The film-makers say that their aim is to promote education and family harmony. China is a deeply conservative place, even as it prepares to celebrate its revolutionary past. Chinese children, told constantly to be diligent and obedient, sensed that all along. *

全文文献: Headnote A suspicious China prepares for America to pull out of Afghanistan
On may эти China's foreign ministry was asked to comment on an atrocity in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Terrorists had detonated a car bomb outside a girls' school, then two more bombs to kill pupils running for safety. At least 68 people had died, most of them children. The attack was aimed at girls from a Shia minority that is often targeted by Sunni Islamist groups, which have brought much misery to Afghanistan. Today such groups are jostling for blood-soaked advantage ahead of a full withdrawal of American forces, at the latest by September 11th this year, as ordered by President Joe Biden. China's diplomats could have responded to the latest violence in several plausible ways.
It would have been reasonable for the foreign ministry to tell the largest militant group, the Taliban, to rein in the mayhem, for China enjoys growing leverage over the Taliban's leaders. That may seem counterintuitive. China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, has expressed hope that future Afghan governments will embrace moderate Islam: an apparent rebuke of Taliban-style zealotry. Across the border, in China's north-western region of Xinjiang, officials have demolished mosques and banned young people from public prayers. In all perhaps a million Muslims, most of them from the Uyghur minority, have passed through re-education camps in Xinjiang, set up to cure them of excessively religious or "backwards" thinking, and to turn them into biddable workers, loyal to the Chinese motherland.
But the Taliban can be both fanatical and pragmatic, it turns out. Their leaders hope to rule Afghanistan soon, a quarter of a century after they first subjected the country to a reign of pious terror. Especially over the past three years, say scholars and diplomats in Beijing and other capitals, links between the Afghan Taliban and China have grown remarkably. Anxious for political recognition and economic backing from their giant neighbour, Taliban delegations have approved of Chinese plans to build motorways between Afghan cities. They claim to support a Chinese-funded project near Kabul to create one of the world's largest copper mines, which has been stalled for years by concerns about ancient Buddhist ruins on the site and by fears of militant attacks.
Privately, it is said, the Taliban have signalled that they do not care about Xinjiang. That relates to China's main interest in Afghanistan: to prevent that unhappy country from sliding into chaos and becoming a haven or transit corridor for Uyghur militants who, China is sure, lurk in the region. Those fighters, China believes, include some with combat experience in Syria, some trained by Iran, and others who hope to enter Xinjiang through lawless tribal regions of Pakistan.
It would have been reasonable, too, for China to have asked Pakistan to help stem the bloodshed. Pakistan is the Taliban's patron, and has prodded the Afghan militants to establish ties with China. Pakistan likes to be useful to China, its most important sponsor. But the ministry chose a different response. After deploring the murder of the schoolgirls in Kabul, its spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, singled out America for blame. She charged that the "abrupt" announcement of America's exit from Afghanistan had "led to a series of explosive attacks throughout the country". She called on foreign troops "to pull out in a responsible manner and avoid inflicting more turmoil and suffering on the Afghan people".
This is a new criticism. Chinese scholars and state media have spent years accusing American forces of straying beyond their original mission to eradicate al-Qaeda and of spreading turmoil with their naive dreams of Western-style nation-building. More recently, they have asserted that America will surely leave behind covert operatives after its troops leave, in part to make trouble for China. In short, China believes that America has stayed too long in Afghanistan, is departing too hastily and is not really leaving at all.
That line of argument is tangled enough. Making it more so, Chinese officials now call Afghanistan an area of possible co-operation with America, along with climate change and efforts to curb nuclear proliferation. When pressed for detail, including at a recent meeting with American counterparts in Anchorage, Chinese envoys are vague. A few years ago China and America did jointly train Afghan diplomats and police. These days China stresses the importance of its Belt and Road Initiative: how the infrastructurebuilding scheme can promote Afghan development and thus stability, such as by connecting the country to the sea via Pakistan.
Afghanistan once saw remarkable co-operation. Early in the war on terror, President George W. Bush's administration designated a Uyghur group, the East Turkistan Independence Movement (etim), as terrorists. Chinese agents were allowed to interrogate Uyghurs detained in Guantanamo Bay. They told one Uyghur he was lucky to be in American hands, since "as soon as they got him back to China, he was dead", his lawyer later told Congress. Such joint action is unthinkable now: the two sides are so far apart on Xinjiang. In 2020 the Trump administration delisted etim as a terror group, expressing doubts that it still existed. China says it is a grave menace.
To China, nothing matters more than stability
China sees its positions as coherent. Singling out America as a troublemaker is logical. It also distrusts the Taliban, Pakistan and Iran, but those actors have reasons to bow to China's will, so do not need public scolding. In contrast, America is a dangerous rival that has made bad mistakes, so is an ideal target for criticism. China may support regional or un peacekeeping missions in Afghanistan, if its neighbour seems on the brink of civil war. But it will not send its own troops to keep order, at least under a Chinese flag, because its neighbour is a "graveyard of empires". Afghanistan's case is revealing. China is emerging as a great power that-to an exceptional degree-trusts in cold, hard economic and security interests alone. To China, self-interest is wisdom. *

摘要: In cruel consequence, girls were often killed at birth. Since the Qin dynasty in the third century, a family without adult sons might recruit a poor but healthy man to "lend his strength" to their household as a live-in son-in-law. Lone children must care for elderly parents without any help from siblings, which is one reason why many of them do not want offspring of their own. Because China is missing millions of women, lots of young men will never marry. Never mind love, let's talk apartments Mr Li is busy, fielding telephone calls from potential clients and turning away a young man who walks in but lacks a college degree.

The lingyin temple in Hangzhou, a lovely, tree-shaded place, has long drawn those seeking the blessings of a good marriage or children. Pilgrims may still be glimpsed today. On a recent afternoon Chaguan watched a mother and daughter leave a tour group to pray, incense sticks held aloft, to a statue of Guanyin, a Buddhist immortal, before hurrying back to their guide.
In centuries past, praying was all that many Chinese, especially women, could do, for they were powerless about much in their lives. Marriage was a transaction between families, not a love match. It led, almost invariably, to a woman moving into her husband's home. There, her role was to give birth to heirs, meaning sons, and to care for his parents in their dotage. A woman could not own property and, once bridal payments and dowries had been exchanged, brought so few benefits to her birth family that married daughters were likened to "sprinkled water". In cruel consequence, girls were often killed at birth.
A few marriages were different. Since the Qin dynasty in the third century, a family without adult sons might recruit a poor but healthy man to "lend his strength" to their household as a live-in son-in-law. Some signed contracts agreeing to give their children their wife's surname and to look after their parents-in-law before their own father and mother. Shocked by such breaches of filial piety, officials in the Yuan and Ming dynasties (between the 13th and the 17th centuries) banned men who were only sons from entering into such unions. Men who did faced widespread scorn. They were called zhuixu, or "mortgaged sons-in-law", or, more politely, shangmen nuxu-"gate-entering sons-in-law".
Modern China is becoming more open-minded about what constitutes a good family, and with good reason. A national census unveiled on May 11th showed that China is ageing fast and has one of the world's lowest fertility rates, so its population will soon be shrinking. Though the one-child policy became a two-child policy for most urban residents in 2016 and is set to loosen further, its malign effects will endure. Lone children must care for elderly parents without any help from siblings, which is one reason why many of them do not want offspring of their own. Because China is missing millions of women, lots of young men will never marry. Years of illegal, sex-selective abortions skewed China's birth ratio. The census finds that 111 boys are born for every 100 girls.
With fewer women, an optimist might imagine they would gain more power over whom they marry. There are other reasons why chauvinist traditions may fade. China is an increasingly urban, mobile country. Some 376m people live in a different city or town from the place named on their hukou, the household registration papers that limit where Chinese may live, work and obtain public health care or schooling. China is better educated, with over 200m university graduates. What is more, women students have outnumbered men on college campuses since 2009. In another change, families that own homes in larger cities have become wealthy after a decades-long property boom, especially if they bought apartments 20 or more years ago. Lots of those newly rich families have one child, a daughter, and-quite properly-are ambitious for her. The Beijing College Students Panel Survey, a big study, found that women students are more likely than men to come from affluent big-city families (and to study liberal arts). Male students are more likely to hail from poorer, provincial families and to study sciences or engineering, reflecting family hopes that they will land well-paid technical jobs.
Predictably, it is not hard to find educated, urban women demanding more say over their lives. At the Hangzhou temple, Chaguan meets a fresh-faced couple emerging from the Guanyin shrine, and asks what they wished for. "I prayed we'll endure the test of time, I don't know about him," replies Chen Jiajia, shyly scrutinising her boyfriend, Chen Jingsheng. Now 25, they met at high school in the southern province of Guangdong and have been together for seven years. Most women expect a man to own an apartment before marrying, Mr Chen said. That is a big pressure in a city as expensive as Guangzhou, where he works in information technology. A native of a small city, Meizhou, he lacks a Guangzhou hukou, another obstacle to buying property. Ms Chen has Guangzhou papers, and her family helped the couple to buy a flat. "They see potential in him, they think he is driven. If he weren't, our parents would not support us in this way," explains Ms Chen, who works in e-commerce.
Less predictably, such social trends are bringing new attention to an old tradition, that of zhuixu. Li Jiyan, a matchmaker from Xiaoshan, a district of Hangzhou, specialises in finding graduates from poorer provinces to marry property-owning women from his city. His file-choked office is lined with framed photographs of him being interviewed by Chinese television stations and newspapers about the 1,000 marriages he has brokered since 1999. Men on his books must be graduates of vocational college or university, earn 100,000 yuan ($15,540) a year and be taller than 1.70m. Crucially, they do not need to own property in Hangzhou.
Never mind love, let's talk apartments
Mr Li is busy, fielding telephone calls from potential clients and turning away a young man who walks in but lacks a college degree. "Don't give up," he calls after the crestfallen youth. By taking in a poor outsider, families gain a biddable son-in-law and children bearing their mother's name, he enthuses. He adds approvingly that "non-local boys" will take humble jobs, like riding delivery scooters, if graduate work dries up. Though he praises self-made men, Mr Li's business model is really founded on inequality, a scourge of ancient and modern China alike. In a moment of candour, his wife once remarked that no home-owner would become a gate-entering son-in-law. The couple charge 15,000 yuan for two years' matchmaking. If that fails, there is always prayer. *

全文文献: Headnote Disillusioned with foreign firms and domestic tech giants, more Chinese want to be officials
When zhu ling graduated last year from a highly competitive master's programme at one of China's best universities, prestigious, well-paid jobs were hers for the taking. Instead she chose to become a civil servant for the central government, earning 6,000 yuan ($930) a month, or less than some Beijing professionals spend on gym membership.
A decade ago, Miss Zhu (not her real name) might have joined a multinational firm. They pay well, and it was "cool to work for foreign companies, because that shows your international horizons, and you can travel all over the world", she says over cappuccino at an outdoor cafe in Beijing. Five years ago, top graduates vied to join home-grown technology giants like Alibaba, Tencent or Huawei. In addition to high salaries, such firms had free-thinking cultures and seemed to respect young people, she explains.
Today, the trends are changing again. China still wants foreign businesses for their know-how and dynamism, but their status "is definitely going down", says Miss Zhu. Geopolitical distrust is bleeding into work relations. Chinese employed by foreigners have noticed that they never advance beyond middle management and are the first to be laid off in bad times, she claims. As for domestic technology firms, their high salaries continue to attract the young. But they also face vocal criticism in Chinese media for domineering business practices and the "996" work schedules of their staff, toiling from at least 9am to 9pm, six days a week. In all, a third of Miss Zhu's classmates took civil-service examinations. Some were hired by state-owned banks. Three joined technology companies. None joined a foreign firm.
Chinese refer to securing an official position as shang an, or "landing ashore", reflecting the security such jobs offer. In 2020, 1.6m people passed background checks to take national civil-service exams, 140,000 more than the year before. Almost a million candidates eventually sat the exam, chasing 25,700 jobs. Still more took tests to become provincial and local officials. Many were fleeing a bleak market for new graduates, as covid-19 hit private firms.
Miss Zhu says she joined an elite government ministry in search of meaningful work. She will soon spend two years as an official in a remote rural area, saying: "If you want to become a good policymaker, you have to go to the grassroots level." A decade ago her parents would not have wanted her to join the public sector, she thinks. They distrusted officials, who routinely shook them down for bribes. Back then they would also have worried about her prospects as someone with no family guanxi, or connections: her grandfather was a farmer and her parents run a small business. She credits an anti-corruption drive that began in 2012 with changing their views of officialdom.
Miss Zhu's blend of ambition and idealism is a good fit with the times. Qiushi, a theoretical journal, recently published a speech that President Xi Jinping made in January to national and provincial leaders. He described "chaos" in the outside world, celebrated China's new strength and declared that "time and momentum are on our side". Mr Xi also identified risks for China, ranging from dependence on foreign technologies to political turmoil should "an insurmountable gap between the rich and the poor" appear. He told officials to study the Soviet Union's collapse, after its ruling Communist Party became "a privileged bureaucracy that defended only its own interests".
Aware of public anger about inequality, Chinese propaganda has taken a populist turn, presenting the party as an ally against rapacious capitalism. In April authorities launched an anti-trust probe into Meituan, a food-delivery giant. Two days later Beijing Television showed a city official spending a day undercover, riding an electric scooter for Meituan. The exhausted bureaucrat told viewers that the work is "too difficult", earning praise for his caring ways from the People's Daily, a flagship party newspaper. Official media did not mention Chen Guojiang, a real-life Beijing delivery rider detained after posting videos of grim working conditions. He was charged on April 2nd with "picking quarrels and provoking trouble", a catch-all crime used against activists who challenge the party's monopoly over questions of social justice.
Miss Zhu admits that idealism is not the only reason to join the public sector. A brilliant classmate might have become a university lecturer, but instead took a post at a highly selective high school. She became a teacher because, years from now, she will be entitled to a school place for her (as yet unborn) child. To millions of hard-pressed parents who see education as their children's only hope of getting ahead, such planning makes perfect sense.
If you can't beat 'em...
Other civil servants accept a low salary because of the heavily subsidised housing, health insurance and pension that go with it. Some small-town or provincial Chinese take on boring government jobs that come with hard-to-secure residence papers for such megacities as Beijing or Shanghai. A sense of filial duty prompted Wu Hong, an only child who graduated in 2008, to leave his software business in the boomtown of Shenzhen and return to his home province of Jiangxi. Mr Wu (not his real name) is now a poorly paid local bureaucrat. "My parents are getting old, and in my small town there is no better place to find a stable job," he says.
OffcN, an adult-education business, prepares millions of students each year for public-sector exams. It grew fast during the pandemic. "Training centres rose like bamboo shoots after rain," says an OffcN manager in Beijing. He once looked down on civilservice jobs. Now he regrets missing the age limit-typically 35- for joining many government departments.
Ordinary Chinese are often cynical about officials as a class, deeming them slow to help and quick to conceal mistakes. But for many in the private economy, just keeping heads above water is an exhausting slog. Small wonder some dream of heading ashore.

全文文献: Headnote China fears containment by American-led alliances. It should worry more about why it is distrusted
LEADERS OF CHINA and America share an obsession: the notion that a large enough coalition of Western democracies might have the heft to confront a rising China about its authoritarian, state-capitalist ways, and demand that it follow a new trajectory, one that does less damage to norms and universal values that have governed the rich world since 1945.
China fears a broad, American-led coalition as the one force that might still be able to contain it. Not so long ago its foreign minister, Wang Yi, mocked the Quad, an informal group uniting America, Australia, India and Japan, as so much "sea foam". After America hosted a Quad-leaders summit, China has called the group a destabilising scheme to build an Asian nato. The Trump administration expanded the role of the Five Eyes, an intelligencesharing pact between America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. The group issued a statement in November 2020 about the crushing of political freedoms in Hong Kong. But the Five Eyes should be careful not to be "poked and blinded", a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman growled. Australia and Canada are being punished with trade sanctions and detention of their citizens to teach them the cost of helping America in disputes with China.
Under President Joe Biden, American enthusiasm for coalition-building has only grown. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, explained to cbs News recently why America seeks allies to confront China's government about repression at home and aggression overseas, as well as its adversarial approach to trade. "We're much more effective and stronger when we're bringing like-minded and similarly aggrieved countries together to say to Beijing: 'This can't stand and it won't stand'," Mr Blinken said.
In fact, these two rival powers are obsessing about something that is not likely to happen. For one thing, America's allies have few illusions that any group of outsiders, even one led from Washington, can tell today's China what will and will not stand. As a Western diplomat in Beijing glumly notes, such countries as Britain, France and Germany "are close to accepting the inevitability of China's rise", and so are out of alignment with America. For another, lots of Western democracies are fractious and mistrustful, especially after four years of Trumpian bridge-burning. European and Asian democracies alike are wary of joining America in anything resembling a cold-war effort to check China's aggression- especially if it jeopardises profitable trade relationships.
France's president, Emmanuel Macron, said this year that it would be counter-productive for Western powers "to join all together against China". The German chancellor, Angela Merkel has also spoken out against the "building of blocs". In recent telephone and video calls with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders, there is no record of her raising sweeping sanctions imposed by China on European politicians and researchers, in retaliation for eu sanctions targeting officials accused of brutally repressing Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang.
Official read-outs instead record Mrs Merkel talking of co-operation and praising a draft trade pact agreed with China last year, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, which would offer more access to China's market for some eu firms, notably German carmakers. Ironically, the agreement may be doomed by the sanctions that Mrs Merkel wants to ignore. Those punished by China include members of the European Parliament, which must approve the pact. The eu trade commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis, said on May 4th that efforts to finalise the deal are on hold.
eu unity is further undermined by members with close investment ties to China, such as Greece. One member does not conceal its admiration for Chinese autocracy, charges a European diplomat in Beijing: "The eu has its traitor in the ranks: Hungary." Nor is there consensus within the Five Eyes. In recent weeks, New Zealand's government declared itself uncomfortable with the intelligence-sharing pact's releasing geopolitical statements.
China loves all such signs of disunity, praising European nations for seeking "strategic autonomy", a French phrase that means not marching in lockstep with America. Yet in its paranoia about American-led alliances bent on containment, China risks missing a change that is actually happening in the real world.
Even as they concede that the time for trying to change China is over, rich-world democracies are defensively China-proofing their economies and their societies. They are setting up new investment-screening laws, investigating whether foreign powers are meddling in their domestic politics and universities, and writing public-procurement rules to block bidders who raise nationalsecurity concerns. The eu is proposing new curbs on state-subsidised firms wanting to compete in European markets. Such policies do not always name China, but it is the target.
Standing together, sort of
Foreign ministers of the G7 countries-America, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan-met in London on May 3rd-5th. Their closing communique condemns Chinese abuses in Xinjiang, including "the existence of a large-scale network of 'political re-education' camps, and reports of forced labour systems and forced sterilisation". The solutions offered are purely defensive, and make no pretence that the G7 can change Chinese policies. The risk of importing goods made with forced labour will have to be tackled through "our own available domestic means", the ministers say, by raising awareness and advising businesses.
Such words do not frighten China. Confident in the power offered by its vast market, it hopes that foreign governments will hurry up and realise that resistance to its rise is futile. If resistance means forming blocs to contain China, then America's allies already agree. But those same democracies are also channelling a growing distrust into defences that will introduce new frictions into relations with China. Friction is a form of resistance, too.

全文文献: Headnote Hong Kong's noisy patriots denounce a world-class collection of Chinese art
China's leaders seem sure that innovation can co-exist with authoritarian rule. Their confidence looks more rational than it once did: Chinese firms dominate some high-tech fields. Still, they have to explain a counterpoint: when freedoms increased in China over the past 40 years, greater creativity always followed.
Uli Sigg, a Swiss businessman and diplomat, first reached na in as reformers began to dismantle the Mao-era planned economy. Later, he spent decades building an unrivalled collection of contemporary Chinese art. He was sent to China by Schindler, a Swiss manufacturer of lifts, for whom he established the first Chinese joint-venture with a foreign firm. Rather than a capitalist revolution, he describes years of caution, as entrepreneurs worried that open doors would slam shut. He recalls campaigns against Western "spiritual pollution" that frightened colleagues into ditching suits and ties and reverting to workers' jackets in blue cotton. But time and again, opening sparked innovation.
An art-lover, Mr Sigg reached China during a brief moment of creative daring. Months earlier, avant-garde artists had staged an unauthorised show on the railings of the national gallery in Beijing, before police swooped. Soon afterwards their movement was pushed underground for much of the 1980s. Many were young, self-taught, and technically crude. Few ordinary Chinese saw their art. Yet those who did were visibly excited by its spirit. "Traditional art takes you to a sublime place and then you come back. Contemporary art changes you. It produces an openness; maybe it is stupid or aggressive. But that is the link to creativity," explains Mr Sigg. Foreigners often assumed that artists were dissidents. In fact, after growing up amid the bossy propaganda of socialist realism-vast canvasses of dauntless workers, bumper harvests and benevolent leaders-many were tired of politics and content to share their work with a few elite insiders.
In the 1990s Mr Sigg set out to record this ferment, putting his own tastes aside to acquire hundreds of artworks as a public institution might. At one point he sought to preserve propaganda images that younger artists despised, though their aesthetic influence was obvious. He found former masters of socialist realism in dingy provincial apartments, and bought once-feted paintings now rolled up under their creators' beds. These forgotten propagandists offered another lesson: skills prized in a closed system are little help when times change. An oddly poignant item in the Sigg collection is a very late work of socialist realism: a painting of Mao's successor, Hua Guofeng, visiting North Korea in 1978, as doves flutter over his head. In its garish way it represents a peak of technical accomplishment, which soon became pointless as Hua was ousted and state-sponsored kitsch gave way to photography.
As Swiss ambassador to China from 1995 to 1998, Mr Sigg watched cultural bosses wrestle with the Western world's excitement over Chinese avant-garde art, and with the same foreigners' confounding lack of interest in state-approved paintings of flowers and birds. Later, some officials moved to harness the global renown of freethinking artists. Before Ai Weiwei became an exile excoriated by the Chinese state, he helped to design the Bird's Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics of 2008.
In 2010 museum bosses in Hong Kong approached Mr Sigg, after hearing that he hoped to donate his art to a public gallery in China. The government had a site to offer, a vast new harbourside museum in West Kowloon, known as M+. This enthusiasm for experimental art was not a sudden whim. Starting in 1998, Hong Kong's leaders had publicly fretted that the city's economic base, built around finance, logistics and an overheated property market, was dangerously narrow. Their solution came in three parts: strengthening Hong Kong as a financial centre, increasing ties to the mainland and promoting creativity. The first local leader after the end of British rule, Tung Chee-hwa, called for Hong Kong to become "the most cosmopolitan city in Asia". He offered support for creative industries, buttressed by schools that would promote critical thinking via a new subject, liberal studies.
Mr Sigg warned Hong Kong officials about sensitive images in his collection. These include pictures of pro-democracy protests in June 1989 and one of Mao inspecting a urinal, in a homage to Marcel Duchamp. They were undaunted, asking why he would consider offering such works to mainland cities with strict censorship, and stressing Hong Kong's artistic freedoms. In 2012 he donated 1,463 works, worth $160m, and sold the city 47 more.
The hunt for degenerate art
That was then. Now, liberal studies are blamed for inspiring Hong Kong's young to join anti-government protests in 2019, and schools must offer lessons in loving China. On April 19th President Xi Jinping called for Chinese universities to produce students who are both curious and absolutely loyal to the Communist Party.
As for Mr Sigg's collection, it is under fire from Hong Kong politicians seeking to prove their own loyalty. They accuse some images, notably one of Ai Weiwei giving the Tiananmen gate in Beijing his middle finger, of "spreading hatred" against China, in breach of a National Security Law passed last year. Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, pledges to be on "full alert" as M+ staff distinguish between artistic freedoms and national-security threats.
The opening date of M+ is unclear. Mr Sigg can only hope that no artists are banned, for without Ai Weiwei, a Chinese contemporary art museum "would have no academic credibility", he says. Asked whether he regrets his gift to Hong Kong, Mr Sigg replies that he collected the artworks to save them for China's people. He is sure they will all be shown one day, though he may not see it.
Perhaps China's rulers are confident because the innovation they prize is technological, not cultural. Propaganda full of "positive energy" is creative enough for their needs. Hong Kong had its own artistic ambitions. But pleasing the party is the priority.

全文文献: Headnote The Communist Party builds a propaganda festival around its 100th birthday
On a cold and rainy recent night, on a mountain soaked in the blood of early Communist Party martyrs, Chaguan went for a walk to look for ghosts. None could be found. Instead Jinggang Mountain, in the southern province of Jiangxi, revealed itself as an oddly kitsch tourist complex, being readied for nationwide celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the party's founding, in July. Toiling in the dark, work crews were installing floral displays and streetlights topped with red plastic flames.
Tens of thousands died on the mountain between 1927 and 1929, as Mao Zedong and pioneering Red Army units took refuge on its bamboo-clad slopes, hiding from the ruling Nationalist regime and prowling warlords. Some died in combat, others in political purges. Others were killed by cold and disease in a region so poor that locals ate wild vegetables and trapped squirrels for meat.
Today Jinggang Mountain is preserved as a "cradle of the revolution". The local mayor, Jiao Xuejun, calls it "a spiritual place" that "purifies minds and clarifies people's beliefs". For all that, visitors hear little about its complex history. Rather, generic slogans reflect the party's modern-day claim to rule, based on decades of economic development. A typical display, formed from illuminated red characters hanging from trees, reads: "The People Have Faith, the Country Has Strength, the Nation Has Hope".
Tour groups, some in replica Red Army uniforms, throng a museum filled with revolutionary relics before heading to souvenir shops selling Mao statues. Nearby, a China Executive Leadership Academy, overseen by the party's Central Committee, trains highflying officials from around the country. The academy calls itself a furnace where cadres are fired with renewed fervour, via residential courses in party history, discipline and theory: above all, "Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era". Mr Xi visited in 2016. His tribute to the "Jinggang Mountain Spirit" is inscribed on an academy wall.
The mountain witnessed important ideological battles. Mao argued with party chiefs in far-off Shanghai about how to recruit peasants as revolutionary warriors, after urban uprisings failed. Some sharp rows concerned the merits of political terror, and whether to seize land from all landlords, or just the richest. Mao favoured a selective use of violence. He held public-execution rallies at which local gentry were disembowelled with spears, and hung a scaffold with couplets in his own calligraphy, reading: "Watch Us Kill the Bad Landlords Today. Aren't You Afraid?" Mao eagerly recruited mountain bandits as troops and grumbled about the "petty-bourgeois consciousness" of villagers, who rarely volunteered to join the Red Army, wanting instead to farm in peace. When an enemy army drew near in January 1929, Mao abandoned Jinggang Mountain, leaving only a token force to defend thousands of villagers, wounded troops and Red Army wives and children. Massacres followed. An official history published in 1987, during a period of relative candour about Mao's mistakes, cites a party inspector's judgment that the Red Army's 15-month stay left Jinggang Mountain "totally bankrupt".
Such debates are now played down. Chaguan visited the mountain on a government tour, organised to introduce foreign and Chinese journalists to local leaders preparing to fete the party's centenary, as well as to officials studying at the academy. Pressed to explain the Jinggang Mountain spirit, those students carefully refer to Mr Xi's definition of it, which stresses persistence, seeking truth from facts, tackling difficulties and relying on the masses. Smoothly, academy students trace a common "Red culture" connecting early martyrs with material prosperity today. One student, a party chief at a university in central China, recounts how he ferried his son on a bicycle in the 1990s, whereas his soon-to-be-born grandchild will ride in a car. Definitions of happiness evolve, but "the people have always had dreams of a better life," he beams. Another, a provincial vice-president of the All-China Women's Federation, insists that for 100 years "the party's goal hasn't changed, it is wholeheartedly to serve the people."
The right sort of fervour
Academy students take a field trip to a mountain pass, Huangyangjie, made famous after the Red Army held off a bigger enemy force there. Standing to attention in rows, the middle-aged officials recite in unison a Mao poem about this victory. A lecturer assures them-in contradiction of the historical record-that longago locals showed "complete loyalty to the party", praising a villager whose eight children all joined the Red Army. "Relying on the masses is not a pretty slogan, it's a reality forged in fire," the lecturer says, drawing a link with the mobilisation of ordinary Chinese to fight covid-19. "The form of the war may change, but the path of relying on the masses is still the right one," he concludes.
Officials offer simple morality tales about the selflessness of party members, from the Red Army commander who carried grain up the mountain to feed his soldiers, to the students who left "great universities" in Beijing to fight in Jiangxi 90-odd years ago. When visitors learn how highly educated patriots in their 20s sacrificed their lives, they realise that they can overcome their own difficulties, enthuses Mr Jiao, the mayor. An academy boss compares revolutionary martyrs to modern-day party secretaries who volunteered to work in harsh, remote villages to alleviate rural poverty, some of whom perished on the job.
The blandness of these approved stories is no accident. It is hard for today's rulers, obsessed as they are with order and conformity, to celebrate a revolution, even one a century old. A revealing commentary in the People's Daily this month called for party members to practice "self-revolution" and "self-purification" via strict discipline. In the Xi era, a revolutionary spirit is one that submits to party authority. History is a way to measure how far China has come. Ghosts from the real, messy past are not welcome.

摘要: China has selfish reasons for fearing an Iranian bomb, starting with the dangers of a regional arms race, says Mr Yin, a candid sort. Asked about Chinese plans to expand trade with Iran, a State Department spokesman called opposition to Iranian nukes one of a few "narrow areas of tactical alignment" between his country and China. Chinese companies have been told to go out and sell advanced technologies that will carry their country's values and technical standards around the world, notably via the Belt and Road Initiative.

全文文献: Headnote Chinese leaders think they can avoid the traps that caught America. They may find it hard
China's leaders are trying to reinvent how great powers operate in the Middle East. They have busied themselves in recent years signing trade deals and co-operation agreements with regional powers that are, most of the time, rivals or foes of each other. China talks of its warm ties with Israel and Palestine, and has invited both to send envoys to Beijing for peace talks. In the Middle East, a region where trust is hard to find, China is hailed as a reliable supplier of covid-19 vaccines and surveillance technology to Arabs and non-Arabs alike. The world's largest oil importer, China is an irreplaceable trade partner both for Iran, the would-be leader of the Shia world, and for Saudi Arabia, its Sunni nemesis. More than once, Chinese warships have conducted separate exercises with the Iranian and Saudi navies, a few weeks apart.
Chinese leaders sound sure that their country's distinctive approach to geopolitics-one that stresses interests over values, and assumes that most foreigners can be bought for a price-will help them avoid the quagmires into which other outsiders in the Middle East have so often stumbled, from America to the colonial powers of old Europe. China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, while visiting six Middle Eastern countries in late March, deplored "the bad consequences inflicted on the region by external interference". In Iran Mr Wang signed a 25-year co-operation agreement. Its details remain murky, but the deal is thought to involve the exchange of cheap Iranian oil for help building telecommunications networks, hospitals, underground railways and, it is rumoured, ports on some of the world's most strategic waterways.
Chinese leaders make a virtue of their commercial focus. Addressing the Arab League in 2016, President Xi Jinping said that China sought no spheres of influence or geopolitical proxies in the region. Instead, he described a vision of progress built around economic growth, declaring that: "Turmoil in the Middle East stems from the lack of development." Even the hardest problems, such as Iran's loathing for America and Israel, are presented as puzzles that prosperity may solve. N otably, China insists that its promised investments in Iran will help rather than hinder efforts to prod the Iranian regime back into compliance with the nuclear accord (known as the jcpoa) that was brokered by the Obama administration and other powers in 2015. It was abandoned three years later by America's then-president, Donald Trump, who scorned the Obama-era approach of rewarding Iran for suspending nuclearweapons research, and put his faith in harsh economic sanctions.
Yin Gang is a veteran scholar of the Middle East at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think-tank. He sets out why the administration of President Joe Biden should believe that China opposes Iran's nuclear ambitions, even as it seeks to expand Sino-Iranian trade. China has selfish reasons for fearing an Iranian bomb, starting with the dangers of a regional arms race, says Mr Yin, a candid sort. "If there's a Persian bomb, there must be an Arab bomb and a Turkish bomb," he says. Though that may not directly threaten China, "If a nuclear war breaks out in the region, how would China do business with it?"
China's belief is that even the harshest economic sanctions do not stop countries from developing nuclear warheads, Mr Yin declares over tea in Beijing. He cites North Korea as a prime example. China's logic is that Iran will have more reasons to behave if America lifts sanctions and allows Chinese, European and other companies to resume legal trade with Iranian partners. That is why China calls on America to do so, and on Iran to resume compliance with the jcpoa's nuclear curbs. The unblushing self-interest behind those Chinese arguments is actually reason to think them sincere. And the Biden administration appears inclined to heed them, for now. After a high-level meeting in March in Alaska between American and Chinese diplomatic chiefs, Iran's nuclear programme appeared on a shortlist of areas for potential co-operation. Asked about Chinese plans to expand trade with Iran, a State Department spokesman called opposition to Iranian nukes one of a few "narrow areas of tactical alignment" between his country and China.
Foreign diplomats in Beijing note that China does, in fact, pursue political goals in the Middle East, such as by pressing Iran and Arab nations to endorse repression of the Uyghur minority in Xinjiang, a region of western China. Mr Yin offers a cynical riposte. Uyghurs are a Turkic people, and Arabs and Iranians distrust Turks, he says, so "Xinjiang is not a political issue for them." Still, he admits, many Chinese scholars worry about the balancing act that their country is trying to pull off. The Middle East is a place of opportunity but also "a trap, a swamp", he says.
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!
Some Chinese experts talk of America leaving a vacuum in the Middle East. Danny Russel, America's assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs in 2013-17, agrees that China senses a demand for a Chinese presence in the Middle East, amid talk of American unreliability. Chinese companies have been told to go out and sell advanced technologies that will carry their country's values and technical standards around the world, notably via the Belt and Road Initiative. But ambitious deals come with political risks. "The larger your footprint, the more valuable your investments, the more vulnerable you are," suggests Mr Russel, who is now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a research outfit.
Even as America pulls back from the Middle East, its presence hovers over Chinese calculations there. China's most lucrative trade partners are Gulf Arab countries that cannot simply ignore America, their traditional security provider. America may yet ask old allies to take sides, for instance if China wants to build ports in the Middle East with dual commercial and military uses, or co-operate there over sensitive technologies. Amoral commercialism has helped China avoid many pitfalls in the region. Even so, its ambitions may yet run into the sands. *

全文文献: Headnote The Communist Party's aggressive diplomacy is a bet that the West is in irreversible decline
Its gaze fixed on the prize of becoming rich and strong, China has spent the past 40 years as a risk-averse bully. Quick to inflict pain on smaller powers, it has been more cautious around any country capable of punching back. Recently, however, China's risk calculations have seemed to change. First Yang Jiechi, the Communist Party's foreign-policy chief, lectured American diplomats at a bilateral meeting in Alaska, pointing out the failings of American democracy. That earned him hero status back home. Then China imposed sanctions on British, Canadian and European Union politicians, diplomats, academics, lawyers and democracy campaigners. Those sweeping curbs were in retaliation for narrower Western sanctions targeting officials accused of repressing Muslims in the north-western region of Xinjiang.
China's foreign ministry declares that horrors such as the Atlantic slave trade, colonialism and the Holocaust, as well as the deaths of so many Americans and Europeans from covid-19, should make Western governments ashamed to question China's record on human rights. Most recently Chinese diplomats and propagandists have denounced as "lies and disinformation" reports that coerced labour is used to pick or process cotton in Xinjiang. They have praised fellow citizens for boycotting foreign brands that decline to use cotton from that region. Still others have sought to prove their zeal by hurling Maoist-era abuse. A Chinese consul-general tweeted that Canada's prime minister was "a running dog of the us".
Such performance-nationalism is watched by Western diplomats in Beijing with dismay. Envoys have been summoned for late-night scoldings by Chinese officials, to be informed that this is not the China of 120 years ago when foreign armies and gunboats forced the country's last, tottering imperial dynasty to open the country wider to outsiders. Some diplomats talk of living through a turning-point in Chinese foreign policy. History buffs debate whether the moment more closely resembles the rise of an angry, revisionist Japan in the 1930s, or that of Germany when steely ambition led it to war in 1914. A veteran diplomat bleakly suggests that China's rulers view the West as ill-disciplined, weak and venal, and are seeking to bring it to heel, like a dog.
In Washington and other capitals it is not hard to hear voices suggesting that China is making rash, clumsy mistakes. Surely China sees that it is souring public opinion across the West, they murmur. There is puzzlement about how China now views its recent draft accord with the European Union, the Comprehensive Investment Agreement, which it had appeared so eager to conclude. That pact's ratification by the European Parliament is now on ice, and possibly entombed in permafrost, as a result of China's sanctions on several Euro-legislators.
In reality Chinese leaders, if their own words and writings are any guide, think that assertiveness is rational. First, they believe that China has numbers on its side as a world order emerges in which developing countries demand, and are accorded, more sway. At the un most member states reliably support China, as an irreplaceable source of loans, infrastructure and affordable technology, including surveillance kit for nervous autocracies. Second, China is increasingly sure that America is in long-term, irreversible decline, even if other Western countries are too arrogant and racist to accept that "the East is rising, and the West is in decline", as Chinese leaders put it. China is now applying calculated doses of pain to shock Westerners into realising that the old, American-led order is ending.
China's rulers are majoritarians. Their hold on power involves convincing most citizens that prosperity, security and national strength require iron-fisted, one-party rule. They unblushingly put the interests of the many over those of the few, whether those individuals are farmers evicted to build a dam, ethnic minorities re-educated to become biddable workers, or dissenters who must be silenced. China is a hard challenge for liberal democrats precisely because its tyranny in the name of the majority is backed by lots of Chinese, albeit at a terrible cost to outliers and minorities. Today, Chinese ideas about global governance sound like a majoritarian world order. Ruan Zongze, a scholar at the foreign ministry's Xi Jinping Diplomatic Research Centre, explained the official line in a press briefing. He denied that China wanted to export its values. But he outlined a vision of multilateralism-by-majority that-by according no special legitimacy to liberal norms-would be a safe haven for Chinese autocracy. Mr Ruan scorned governments that "use the pretext of democracy to form alliances". He called that "fake multilateralism", adding that developing countries need not endure finger-pointing from a West that does not speak for the world. As engines of global growth, China and other emerging economies should have a bigger say, he declared. "Those who represent future trends should be the leading force."
The majority of the tyrannies
As one European diplomat sees it, at least part of China's establishment is convinced that the liberal order established after 1945- built around universal human rights, norms and rules that bind the strong and weak alike-is an obstacle to China's rise. Such revisionists are "convinced that China will not achieve its goals if it plays by the rules", he says.
Diplomats describe a China that is hubristic and paranoid. They say some Chinese officials are convinced that the eu will soon drop its Xinjiang-related sanctions, because Europe cannot recover from the pandemic without Chinese growth. Other Chinese officials worry that their country is making too many enemies, and tell diplomats as much. Alas, they are outnumbered by those who blame China's unpopularity on Western resentment of Chinese success. China's rulers are duly preparing for a protracted struggle. The risks are clear, both for China and the West. *

全文文献: Headnote In the name of social stability, Chinese divorce courts deny women their rights
According to the letter of the law, a Chinese family court should be a safe haven for Wang Fumei (not her real name), a 36-year-old battered wife and mother of two. In-store security cameras were rolling when her husband, a heavy-drinking gambler, came to the shop where she worked in southern China, and beat her without pity. The tape is now with the police. It gives Ms Wang grounds to invoke a law against domestic violence that took effect in 2016, allowing judges to punish abusive partners.
If called as witnesses, the couple's children would have little reason to defend their father. The 16-year-old son is a migrant labourer-his father refused to pay for vocational training that might have helped the boy into better work. The ten-year-old daughter is scared to hear her father's name. Though safe in her mother's home village, she cannot start middle school this September unless her father hands over the family's household-registration book, or hukou, which is needed to enroll her. Even a screenshot would do, the school principal says. Alas, Ms Wang's mother-in-law has told her grand-daughter by telephone: "Your schooling is not our business." On paper, there are other reasons to trust in the law. Ms Wang's meagre income should qualify her for legal aid from the state. The country's supreme court has repeatedly told judges to pay more heed to equality for women.
In the real world, China's family courts are places of peril for women like Ms Wang. The details are laid out in two books by Chinese-born legal scholars. Between them they draw on thousands of hours of interviews with small-town judges, lawyers and ordinary folk seeking a divorce, many of them rural women whose views of marriage were transformed by their move to a big city. The first work, "Divorce in China: Institutional Constraints and Gendered Outcomes" by He Xin of Hong Kong University, was published in January. The second, "Marriage Unbound: Divorce Litigation, Power and Inequality in Contemporary China", is by Li Ke of John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York. It is due for publication in 2022.
These studies show how sexism seeps into the work of Chinese divorce courts like a poison in the soil or a miasma in the air. The trouble starts before a judge has even opened a case file. Chinese judges earn promotions by handling cases quickly and for avoiding complaints and appeals. (A typical judge in a family court may hear 200 cases a year.) They are rewarded for pressing plaintiffs to withdraw divorce suits and try once more to patch up their marriages. That is one way to respond to Chinese leaders' angst about soaring divorce rates. In 2019 4.15m couples parted ways. Just 9.47m got married, a record low in modern times.
Judges routinely refuse first requests for divorce, obliging plaintiffs to come back after a cooling-off period of up to three months. The policy should exclude cases involving violence, but many judges are too scared to declare a husband an abuser. Some judges fear being assaulted themselves. Others worry about presiding over a case that leads to a family murder. Women reporting abuse pose no threat, so they are brushed aside. But men who threaten violence are sometimes bought off with property or even child custody, especially when a son is involved, judges tell Mr He.
A woman who moves to her husband's rural family home is especially vulnerable, Ms Li finds. Typically she would need to seek divorce in her husband's local court. Often his relatives and neighbours, as well as police officers, decline to testify against a person they see as one of their own. Partly as a result, restraining orders against violent husbands remain vanishingly rare.
Judges are quick to spot those who arrive in court desperate for a divorce or for custody of a child. They press such needy parties to give up property or make crippling cash payments to a spouse to "buy" their freedom. That dynamic hurts women, who initiate 70% of divorces. In other cases the parent with less money, usually the mother, is simply deemed too poor to keep a child. Judges do not want to spend time haggling over a child-support order, not least because in China such rulings are hard to enforce.
Ms Wang is vulnerable in all those ways. Desperate to keep her daughter, she needs a court to help obtain their precious hukou papers. Worse, even if she were to secure legal aid, state stipends for lawyers are so low that many legal-aid counsel just "go through the motions", says a family lawyer in Beijing.
Holding up half the sky, thanklessly
Stories of suffering abound. Ms Guo, a migrant worker from rural Hebei province, in northern China, watched a female colleague who endured a three-year divorce in court, only to lose both children and have to pay 70,000 yuan ($10,730) to her husband. In contrast, Ms Guo sought an uncontested divorce from a civil-affairs office. A clerk ended her marriage in 20 minutes because she sought no assets or compensation from her husband, who had found another woman. "I had a smooth divorce, at great economic and psychological cost," she says over Coca-Colas near her factory in Shenzhen. In a Chinese divorce "all women lose", she adds.
That may seem paradoxical. Enough well-meaning laws have been passed to suggest that leaders do want a more female-friendly China. The solution to the puzzle lies in the Communist Party's priorities. Officials sometimes name three goals for the Chinese legal system: delivering justice and fairness, boosting the efficiency of courts and ensuring social stability. But party bosses take a utilitarian, greatest-good-for-the-greatest-number view of human happiness. Thus judges who bully individuals and place efficiency above fairness are just doing their duty. As for maintaining social stability, that is an overriding obsession of party officials. And a reliable way to avoid social unrest is to side with the powerful against the weak. In a Chinese divorce court that means denying women their rights. In an autocratic regime, cruelty is not an accident, it is structural.

全文文献: Headnote Judgmental fans and cowardly advertisers empower Chinese censors
At the dawn of the digital age Bill Clinton predicted that a combination of capitalism and the internet might liberalise China. His vision was bold, uplifting and wrong. It was the year 2000 and America's then-president saw a revolution in the making, as the Communist Party ceased to be a monopoly provider of everything from jobs and housing to news. In an age of new opportunity and information sources, the party would be less able to control people, Mr Clinton argued, adding: "In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem." Sure, he had heard that China was trying to control its internet. "Good luck! That's sort of like trying to nail Jell-o to the wall," he chuckled.
Party bosses spent the next 20 years proving that, with enough nails, the internet can be hammered into submission. It has been a slog, involving armies of censors, secret police and propaganda officials. Internet firms must employ moderators in their tens of thousands, paid to spot and delete banned ideas and images within seconds. Mr Clinton was not wholly mistaken. The state is less present in many ordinary Chinese lives than before. In some sectors, officials have scrambled to maintain their near-monopoly as providers of approved information. In the news industry, party chiefs have poured resources into staid official news agencies, such as the People's Daily, encouraging them to create livelier subsidiaries to compete with more commercial outlets. Private citizens occasionally dare to report news on their own initiative, and question official accounts of events. For this they are routinely reprimanded, sacked from jobs, detained or jailed.
The entertainment sector is the best place to see how Mr Clinton's predictions went awry, because it is one in which commercial competition has exploded, especially online, but the party's overall grip remains firm. That is remarkable, on the face of it. A generation ago, a few pirate videos aside, state-run television stations and official film-censors enjoyed near-total control over what was seen in homes or cinemas. Not now. Visit a village home and a television may still blare in one corner, half-watched by the very old and the very young. But elsewhere, in every train carriage, canteen or dormitory, individual Chinese will be found gazing at smartphones. They may be watching a drama, a talent contest or short videos by amateurs with big online followings: a dancing farmer, perhaps, or a lorry driver singing on some lonely road. A teenage boy, half asleep on the bus, may be following a livestreamer playing a video game. The young women in the row behind may be watching a social-media influencer with 40m followers peddling lipstick, for China boasts the world's largest and most developed e-commerce market.
All this inclines officials to vigilance. On March 5th, in his annual report to the National People's Congress, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, called for greater public civility in cultural industries, in the name of "advanced socialist culture". Four days earlier, the Chinese Association for Performing Arts, a state-backed body, began enforcing a new list of 15 behaviours that could see actors, musicians and other artists banned from performing for a year or longer. The penalty-incurring activities range from insulting China's national honour to drink-driving, gambling or lip-synching during commercial performances. The guidelines build on earlier moves by industry associations to defend social stability, including rules forbidding depictions of gay love, extramarital affairs, smoking or witchcraft. In today's China, a painfully unequal society, film and television regulators have tried to limit displays of wealth or inherited privilege. To that end they have criticised reality television shows featuring the children of famous people.
Censors have not only kept their grip on entertainers with rules. Lately, the very nature of the modern Chinese internet, a hyper-commercial place patrolled by thin-skinned bullies, is helping them succeed. This is a perilous time to be famous in China. In the first few weeks of 2021, fans, prominent bloggers and state media have united to rebuke so many celebrities that a recent item on Tencent News, an online platform, was headlined: "The era of stars saying sorry is upon us: whatever you did wrong, apologise." Those who have said sorry this year include an actress accused of abandoning two infants born via surrogacy in America and a comedian who made a sexist advertisement for women's underwear. Other apologies have come from a comic actress who posed in a cardigan over the caption "husband-snaring gear", leading to charges of objectifying women; and from a 20-year-old Tibetan horseman caught smoking on camera. Months earlier his good looks and shy smile had shot him to fame and helped him into a job as a goodwill ambassador for his hometown.
When market forces help the Communist Party to rule
Chaguan spoke recently to entertainment-industry veterans. They described famous friends on medication for depression, and explained why. Once, stars were on show only when they made a new film. Now, fans want to scrutinise every detail of actors' lives on social media, and expect perfection from their idols. Established artists see hundreds of new rivals being created annually by talent contests. In a country whose rulers may not be criticised, letting the public pillory the famous is a useful safety valve, especially when stars cause real anger by dodging taxes or otherwise abusing their privilege. Cut-throat competition has raised production values. But political controls have reduced the diversity of cultural offerings. With so many patriotic war films or slick dramas out there, what counts is profitability, not art. Skittish sponsors are quick to flee at the first sign of trouble.
The party no longer monopolises entertainment. But it still writes the rules. Closed off from the world by firewalls and import controls, China's internet and cultural industries have become cartels, rewarding the loyal and the biddable. That gives censors all the power they need.

摘要: Dazhai's barely literate Communist Party secretary, Chen Yonggui, was summoned to Beijing and elevated to the Politburo with the rank of vice prime minister. Shi Yonghong, who heads the cultural relics bureau of the surrounding county, Xiyang, admits that Mao's call to "Learn from Dazhai" led to excesses by the mid-1970s, such as when communes in other parts of China dug terraced fields out of flat plains in their anxiety to obey the chairman. Last month Mr Xi gathered senior leaders to stress the importance of studying party history correctly, to pass "red genes and revolutionary fire" to later generations.

全文文献: Headnote A formerly disgraced place of Maoist pilgrimage plots a comeback
In its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s, the village of Dazhai was called a place of miracles. Millions of revolutionary pilgrims came to hear how local peasants had carved terraced grain-fields and reservoirs from its rocky hillsides, armed with little more than hand tools and love of Chairman Mao Zedong. Dazhai's barely literate Communist Party secretary, Chen Yonggui, was summoned to Beijing and elevated to the Politburo with the rank of vice prime minister. Back then Liang Jiwen was a schoolboy, the son of a Dazhai official. He recalls dignitaries arriving each day in his corner of Shanxi province, in the dust-dry Taihang mountains. He and classmates would wave flowers and sing red hymns at the roadside. "We did not get much studying done," he recalls.
Then came the fall. In 1980, as part of a broader purge of ultraleftists that followed Mao's death in 1976, official Communist Party newspapers called Dazhai a fraud. Investigators charged that its miraculous grain harvests were invented. They described massive cash subsidies channelled to the supposedly self-reliant village, and thousands of soldiers sent to build its engineering marvels.
Now Dazhai is trying for a third act. Local officials have drawn up plans to include their village in a China-wide official campaign to promote "red tourism" and teach party history to the masses. They are pinning particular hopes on their former "people's commune", a well-preserved complex of cave dwellings built in 1966. An evocative place, its entrance gate still decorated with Maoist slogans, it was admitted to a national register of protected sites in 2013. It is still closed to the public, but plans are afoot to buy out current residents. Among them is Jia Cunlian, a widow who has lived in a cave-home there for 30 years. She remembers Chen, the Mao-era boss, as "the best of people", who shared exotic gifts that he had received with villagers, such as melons or raisins. Still, she prefers the present day, saying: "Life was hard back then."
Since the 1990s, most visitors to Dazhai for tourism have been elderly. The village has tried to woo them with nostalgia: familyowned restaurants serving rural dishes, including tree-bark noodles once eaten during times of famine. But local leaders have grander ambitions now, involving what would amount to Dazhai's political rehabilitation. To achieve that, officials are willing to offer doses of candour. Shi Yonghong, who heads the cultural relics bureau of the surrounding county, Xiyang, admits that Mao's call to "Learn from Dazhai" led to excesses by the mid-1970s, such as when communes in other parts of China dug terraced fields out of flat plains in their anxiety to obey the chairman. Mr Shi blames officials in these places for misinterpreting the policy, adding that Dazhai never asked to be a national model. But even that grudging admission of long-ago problems is offset by his claims that Dazhai not only fed itself during the hungriest years of the 1960s, but "sold surplus harvests to the state". He offers no further details to back up that long-debunked assertion. Instead, he talks vaguely but grandly about the "Dazhai spirit", which he defines as hard work and not asking for government handouts.
In an office thick with cigarette smoke, overlooking a snowcovered village square, Dazhai's deputy party secretary, Li Huailian, chimes in. She describes the village's story of hardships as a way to understand what President Xi Jinping means when he tells gatherings that the good times of today did not fall from the sky. Dazhai is prosperous because its people have always been diligent and followed party orders, she declares. "Where the party tells us to go, we go." At first hearing, that is a rather insipid summary of her village's tumultuous past. But these local officials know what they are doing. They want Dazhai to be a celebrated red-tourism site, promoted alongside revolutionary bases on the route of the Long March. To achieve that, they need to grasp the role that history plays in the Xi era. To Mr Xi and his team, the past exists to provide reasons to admire the party, not to furnish evidence for judgments about its rule.
Not just popes who like to claim infallibility
Real history is dangerous stuff. Past adulation of Dazhai and of its boss, Chen-a zealot who ordered 141 political executions and said that revolutionaries could grow grain on sandy beaches-is a reminder that to Mao, party rule was a faith-based project. It often put ideology above expertise and common sense, with horrific results. Dazhai's denunciation in 1980 reflected moves by China's then-paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, to create a rational, technocratic state. Deng's gamble was that the party did not need personality cults to maintain support. Instead, he sought a mandate based on making China strong and prosperous. To make a case for market-based reforms that he believed vital to that project, he was pragmatically willing to allow Maoist mistakes to be named.
Mr Xi favours a synthesis of these two approaches. As the party approaches its 100th anniversary in July, its leaders urge the public to contrast China's economic rise and social stability with economic decline and political chaos in the West. That is a Deng-style appeal to performance legitimacy. Yet that co-exists with boosterish talk of "the brilliant achievements and valuable experience accumulated by our party". Maoist disasters are not mentioned. In the Xi era, when Chinese scholars dwell on past mistakes they are guilty of "historical nihilism", a career-ending offence. When foreigners remember old horrors, the charge is that they seek to overthrow Communist rule. Last month Mr Xi gathered senior leaders to stress the importance of studying party history correctly, to pass "red genes and revolutionary fire" to later generations.
Mr Xi seeks a mandate that is both pragmatic and faith-based. The common thread is absolute loyalty. By the logic of the Xi era, the Chinese are able to benefit from wise party rule today because they always trusted the party, even when it erred. Objectively, Dazhai does not deserve to be a place of pilgrimage again. Still it may happen. In China, the past is what the party needs it to be. *

全文文献: Headnote China's high-speed trains enable long-distance commuting. Officials are not sure they approve
Few children grow up dreaming of being a commuter. But there is a logic to a life spent between a city job and a home in some quiet, affordable spot. The first modern suburbs sprang up to greet trains puffing out of Victorian London. As countries such as Japan, France and Spain invested in high-speed trains, travelling at 25okph or more, new pairs of cities found themselves an hour or so apart, allowing for previously unthinkable commutes.
Now it is China's turn. Planners did not have commuters in mind when they began building the world's largest high-speed rail system just over a decade ago. They started with national trunk lines and regional spurs, to bind together a vast country and boost growth. Now, with more than 35,000km of lines laid, planners are building more intercity routes, creating conditions for fast, short hops. One study in 2018, using mobile-phone data to track movements, found tens of thousands of people commuting from neighbouring cities into Shanghai, a megalopolis of 24m. Most of them came from Suzhou, a historic city half an hour away by fast train.
Last year the Journal of Transport & Health, an international outlet, published a survey of such pioneering riders. The typical respondent was a married man with one or two children, a middling-to-high income and a university degree. Three-quarters became long-distance commuters only after the arrival of highspeed rail. More of them describe intercity travel as a route to a better job than to a higher quality of life. Indeed, many call commuting stressful, and something to do "when they are young", notes a co-author of the survey, Chia-Lin Chen of the University of Liverpool. China's high-speed railways do not sell season tickets to commuters, who must often scramble to secure daily tickets on trains meant for long-distance travellers. Moreover, to promote newly built districts, high-speed railway stations are often built far from existing city centres, obliging commuters to travel long distances from stations to workplaces. All this exacts a toll on marriages and families, says Ms Chen.
The Xiao Langfang housing complex is a cluster of apartment blocks in the small, nondescript city of Langfang, 60km from central Beijing. It is an excellent base for commuting-a seven-minute walk from a high-speed railway stop that is, in turn, a 21-minute ride from Beijing South station. The one-way fare is 28 yuan ($4.33). It is a friendly spot. On a mid-week afternoon, its landscaped grounds are thronged with children flying kites, yapping lapdogs and old women playing cards in the winter sun. Above all, here in the northern province of Hebei, just outside Beijing's city limits, property is cheap. Apartments in Xiao Langfang sell for 15,000 yuan a square metre. A comparable flat in Beijing could easily cost six times as much.
Shao Zeyu, a young father playing with his five-year-old son in the compound's gardens, met his wife in Beijing and rented a home with her there for years. They left the capital after their child was born. Mr Shao's legally registered hometown is Langfang, while his wife is from Tianjin, a nearby coastal city. Mr Shao's mother lives in Langfang, so she can offer both love and free child care. But the family faced constraints, too. It is very hard to obtain a new household-registration permit, or hukou, from Beijing, a city that Chinese leaders consider full. Without a Beijing hukou, the Shao family could not easily gain access to many public services in that city, including school places. So they left.
The train has been a boon. Initially, his wife carpooled from Langfang to her job in northern Beijing. She left at 5:30am and reached her desk before most colleagues, allowing her to return home early to see her son. In bad traffic the journey could take three hours each way, and left her exhausted. The fast train to Beijing enables her to leave home at seven. That makes the Shao family lucky. Many friends work such brutal hours, until nine or ten each evening, that they come home only at weekends. Mr Shao himself used to work similar hours for a computer-games firm in Beijing, and is now looking for a job he can do locally. Because Tianjin is affordable and offers better schools and an easier route to university, the family expects to move there when their son is older. Mr Shao's wife plans to commute by train from Tianjin.
In China working nine-to-five is a luxury
Such hyper-mobility is new in China. The government is promoting a new form of urban development that embraces multi-city clusters, including one uniting Beijing and Tianjin. But the aim is to make it more appealing to live in a wider range of secondary cities and new towns, not to create alternative routes to work in central Beijing. In 2016 the Communist Party boss of Hebei said that Langfang "absolutely cannot become a dormitory town for those who work in Beijing". Indeed, China's tax system currently punishes commuter towns. Someone who works in Beijing pays taxes and social-security contributions into the capital's coffers, even when sleeping each night in Langfang. Locals murmur that officials in Langfang blocked moves to call a housing development "Shouzhan", meaning "First Stop" on the line from Beijing.
The authorities in Langfang want new residents to live and work in their city. They recently eased restrictions on outsiders buying property there, allowing them to invest if they make six months' worth of social-security payments to Langfang's fund (on top of payments made elsewhere). But Langfang should be realistic, suggests a local property-salesman. He calls his home town a place where newlyweds and those starting families will choose to live until they can afford to move on.
In truth, Langfang's greatest asset is being a convenient stop on the way to bigger places. That is a puzzle for officials rewarded for developing the place under their charge, not for facilitating the restless ambitions of individuals. China's high-speed railways are a spectacular economic achievement. Their impact on society may prove as dramatic, if officials allow it.

全文文献: Headnote America is losing its ability to deter a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Allies are in denial
China's rise involves some fateful decisions for President Xi Jinping, the country's leader. None matters more than whether to attack Taiwan, to bring that democratic, pro-Western island of 24m people under Communist Party control. If, one day, an armoured Red Flag limousine carries Mr Xi as a conqueror through the streets of the island's capital, Taipei, he will become a Communist immortal. He will join Mao Zedong as co-victor of a Chinese civil war that was left unfinished in 1949 when the defeated Nationalist regime fled to exile in Taiwan.
Perhaps Mr Xi will ride through Taipei streets still scorched by fire, stained with blood and emptied of ordinary Taiwanese by the diktats of martial law. But Taiwan's conquest would still mark China's elevation to the ranks of powers so mighty that no single country dares to defy their wishes. To the hard men who rule China, history is not written by the squeamish. Should Mr Xi order the People's Liberation Army to take Taiwan, his decision will be shaped by one judgment above all: whether America can stop him. For 71 years Taiwan's existence as a self-ruled island has relied on deterrence of Chinese aggression by America. True, Taiwan also benefited from a degree of Chinese patience, as China tried other gambits that might avoid war.
Since the days of Deng Xiaoping, Chinese leaders have been binding Taiwan to the mainland economically. They have also tried to woo the Taiwanese public with promises of autonomy should they accept rule from Beijing, under the rubric of "one country, two systems". That concept was transformed last year from dubious to empty by the crushing of civic freedoms in Hong Kong, a territory that was offered similar promises. But China is losing patience with "peaceful reunification", and colder calculations have always mattered more. At root, China stayed its hand for fear that Taiwanese troops would hold it off until American rescuers arrived.
America's centrality to this stand-off is well-known to President Joe Biden and his foreign-policy aides, who are an experienced bunch. That is why, on the Biden administration's fourth day in office, the State Department rebuked China for military, economic and diplomatic attempts to intimidate Taiwan, and declared America's commitment to the island to be "rock solid".
In reality America's ability to deter an invasion over Taiwan is crumbling. The main reason is China's single-minded pursuit, over 20 years, of the advanced weapons and skills needed to keep American forces at bay. Another is Mr Xi's sense of historical destiny, and his use of populist nationalism to bolster his authority- though nationalism also raises the costs of a botched attack. In some forums, American scholars and retired high officials have praised the Trump administration for approving more than $i7bn in arms sales to Taiwan. They have also scolded Trump aides who used showy support for Taiwan as a way to provoke China, without thinking through risks to the island. Some scholar-diplomats, such as Richard Haass of the Council on Foreign Relations (cfr), have urged America to end its policy of "strategic ambiguity", which avoids making explicit pledges to respond to aggression against Taiwan. This vagueness is meant to discourage rash moves by Taiwanese politicians and avoid enraging China.
Bonnie Glaser, an expert on Chinese and Taiwanese security at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, says that the Biden administration is showing resolve when talking about China and Taiwan, because it is "very worried about the potential for accidents and miscalculation". It is sobering to hear Ms Glaser, a well-connected scholar, express concerns about accidental clashes today, for instance between Chinese and Taiwanese aeroplanes or boats, and about the possibility of a deliberate military conflict five or ten years from now.
Robert Blackwill, a former national-security aide to George W. Bush and co-author of a new paper by the cfr, "The United States, China and Taiwan: A Strategy to Prevent War", wants America to create credible "geoeconomic deterrence", as well as to shore up the military kind. He says America, and allies such as Japan, should make clear that China will be expelled from dollar-based financial and trading systems if it attacks Taiwan. Should Chinese commanders urge war, "we want the economic principals in the room" to spell out the costs, says Mr Blackwill.
Asians will miss America if it leaves
Alas, the hardest part of deterring China involves building robust coalitions that are ready to challenge Chinese aggression. Comparisons with the cold war do not capture the problem. West Berlin's survival was seen as a vital national interest by America and its nato allies, who planned for war to stop the Soviets cutting access to the city. But it matters that the Soviet Union was an economic pygmy. Today, there is no consensus among America's regional allies that Taiwan's survival is a vital interest over which it is worth angering China, often their largest trade partner.
Meanwhile Chinese leaders are trying to reduce their country's vulnerability to external economic pressure. In an article last May, Qiao Liang, a retired air force major-general, predicted that in a war over Taiwan, America and its allies would block sea-lanes to Chinese exports and imports, and cut China's access to capital markets. General Qiao duly endorsed Mr Xi's moves to reduce China's dependence on economic demand from the rest of the world. He added that the key to the Taiwan question would be the outcome of China's contest of strength with America. The general is a nationalist provocateur, but his comments reflect the views of many in Mr Xi's China. That should give American allies pause for thought. To many Chinese, Taiwan's recovery is not just a sacred national mission. Its fulfilment would also signal that American global leadership is coming to an end. If China ever believes it can complete the task at a bearable cost, it will act.

摘要: In a rare public humiliation, environmental inspectors reporting to China's leaders recently accused officials at the National Energy Administration of a "deviation in ideological understanding" for allowing too much dirty coal to be burned. Research institutes close to Mr Xi's inner circle, notably at Tsinghua University in Beijing, have laid out paths for the electricity sector to achieve net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050. Li Shuo of Greenpeace, an environmental group, worries about calls to action that are framed as a competition to beat China in sectors like solar or wind power, where China "is so far ahead".

全文文献: Headnote China and America talk of reviving climate-change co-operation. It will not be easy
For the first decades of global wrangling about climate change, China's foot-dragging caused alarm. Its self-interested approach to climate action-once summarised by a Beijing-based diplomat as seeking "maximum credit for the minimum effort"- frustrated governments that were ready to enact costly measures. Worse, China's blame-shifting ways gave cover to politicians clinging to climate denial and inaction in America and elsewhere.
Soon, the most disruptive force in global climate politics may be China's ambition. Its economy is being readied for a low-carbon world sooner than many expected. Its companies are under orders to develop world-beating clean-energy technologies, including by aggressively pushing foreign firms to share them. China says it wants to re-engage with America on climate matters.
Optimists see signs in China of high-level pragmatism in the return from semi-retirement of Xie Zhenhua. He is a well-connected climate negotiator who brokered the burden-sharing agreements between China and the Obama administration that made possible the Paris climate accords in 2015. Mr Xie, China's new climate envoy, has known his American counterpart, John Kerry, for years. Gloomier sorts worry about the distrust and disdain shown by other Chinese officials and scholars who call America a jealous, declining power, bent on containing a rising China. Talks on such subjects as climate cannot prosper when bilateral relations are bad, said a foreign-ministry spokesman, after Mr Kerry promised that he would not trade away American criticisms of Chinese trade or human-rights abuses for climate-related concessions. Chinese co-operation is not like "flowers that can bloom in a greenhouse despite winter chill", the spokesman sniffed.
China's ambitions are disruptive because they are newly credible. They are credible, not because it has been converted to selfless acts of sacrifice, but precisely the opposite. To Communist Party leaders, greenery increasingly aligns with their economic and political interests. China, a populous country that is cruelly lacking in clean water and arable farmland, and which hates having to rely so heavily on imported energy, has a selfish interest in embracing what President Xi Jinping calls "ecological civilisation". Though the Chinese public is not very focused on climate change, citizens care deeply about clean air and water. They stage frequent demonstrations against pollution. In the words of a European diplomat, Mr Xi is convinced that "ecology is key to China's renaissance and is part of the social contract between the Communist Party and the people." China also wants to enhance its global reputation, the diplomat adds: "China cannot be Number One, which is of course its aspiration, without being a climate leader."
Last September, in a speech to the un General Assembly, Mr Xi unexpectedly committed his country to carbon neutrality by 2060. That pledge to offset or capture all carbon dioxide emitted in China would require most fossil fuels to vanish from an economy that currently consumes more than half the coal burned worldwide. In December Mr Xi tweaked existing targets for the year 2030 to make them a bit more ambitious and cover such areas as fossilfuel use, forest cover, and wind and solar installations. In a rare public humiliation, environmental inspectors reporting to China's leaders recently accused officials at the National Energy Administration of a "deviation in ideological understanding" for allowing too much dirty coal to be burned.
The climate battle is not over. Fossil fuels still have powerful defenders in China. Some provinces approved fleets of new coalfired power plants in 2020 while they still could. Chinese banks and businesses still invest in coal-powered plants overseas, from Pakistan to Africa. Still, signs may be glimpsed that China is planning for a different future. Research institutes close to Mr Xi's inner circle, notably at Tsinghua University in Beijing, have laid out paths for the electricity sector to achieve net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050. Indications of seriousness could appear in the next five-year plan, to be unveiled in March. They could include an absolute cap on emissions, a step that China has so far refused, or a promise to advance to 2025 the date when emissions will peak. The current target for this will hardly be a stretch.
Previous high-level co-operation between China and America or the European Union, as in Paris in 2015, involved joint announcements of sweeping goals and targets, intended to prod other countries into action. In these low-trust times, such moments may prove hard to replicate. Instead, there is much talk in Beijing of confidence-building exchanges between experts. Wang Xin, who heads the research bureau of China's central bank, cites promising areas for co-operation with America and other countries. These include joint work on important technologies such as carbon capture and storage, clean coal and hydrogen power, and on developing green financial instruments to fund such efforts. Climate co-operation is needed to tackle a threat to humanity, Mr Wang says. "In the process, it is only natural to strengthen mutual trust and improve relations."
Asking China to show leadership cuts both ways
Obstacles loom. Other countries are wary of helping to strengthen China's industrial policies. In order to sell climate-related measures to voters, Mr Biden talks of creating millions of well-paid jobs by making America an export champion in clean technologies. Li Shuo of Greenpeace, an environmental group, worries about calls to action that are framed as a competition to beat China in sectors like solar or wind power, where China "is so far ahead". Mr Li thinks that China and America may have to settle for "climate engagement" as they pursue common goals in parallel.
China is a latecomer to climate seriousness. Western powers, especially in Europe, have long pushed it to do more. Now, at least when it comes to clean technologies, China's price for saving the world may be asking to lead the world. *

全文文献: Headnote To fight covid-19, migrants are being asked to miss the biggest holiday of the year
No crowd in China is truly anonymous. Subtle badges of class, income and even region mark out individuals in the densest throngs, such as those seen at lunar new year, when hundreds of millions of migrant labourers, white-collar workers and students cram into trains, buses, aeroplanes or cars to visit faraway relatives. China is a country in constant, restless motion. But even in a normal year, it is also a place of hard-to-shed social distinctions.
This is not a normal year. In line with China's ambition of keeping covid-19 infections as close to zero as possible, national health authorities have asked the public to avoid non-essential travel to see in the year of the ox. That is a reasonable request. But the burden falls heavily on those 300m migrant workers, for whom the holiday is often a rare chance to see children and aged parents.
China's transport ministry predicts that a total of 1.7bn journeys will be made during the travel surge either side of new year, which this year falls on February 12th. That is down from about 3bn journeys in 2019, before the pandemic. Millions employed by the government or state-owned enterprises have simply been ordered to stay put. Workers in the private sector being harder to boss about, several wealthy regions are offering bonuses to migrants who abandon plans to return home. These range from cash payments of up to 1,000 yuan ($155), to extra points to help migrants apply for school places or residence papers in the city where they work. Travellers to rural areas with weak health services must take tests for covid-19 and self-isolate on arrival for a week or two.
These various nudges and prods are having a visible impact. On a recent weekday, there was only a thin crowd outside the main railway station in Guangzhou, a southern boomtown of 13m people. Travellers were almost outnumbered by steel-helmeted police officers and guards, as well as health inspectors in protective suits.
Talking to that crowd, it becomes clear that this is no monolithic mass of people. Instead, each individual's decision to return home is shaped by employment status and regional background. Several migrants explain that they are taking off as much as a week earlier than usual. Many private employers have granted flexible holiday dates this year, enabling staff to stagger their departures. That allows all to enjoy emptier trains and roads, and some to get home before the strictest travel rules bite. A fortunate few locals need not worry about interprovincial controls. Chaguan meets one selling noodles part-time outside the station. A university student, she hails from Shantou, a city in the same province as Guangzhou, and plans to pop home by bus. She concedes that classmates from provinces which have seen recent outbreaks, in China's icy north-east, are forbidden to leave college over the holidays. Still, she backs restrictions: "It's best if you stay home and don't cause trouble for the country."
A married couple from Dengzhou county in Henan province are found waiting for their train on a low wall. Fearing infection, they paid for a ride-sharing car to the station to avoid crowded public transport. Both work for the same plastic-tubing manufacturer and are spurning an offer by bosses to pay 1,000 yuan to workers who skip holiday travel-employees' movements can be verified with the help of smartphone health apps that are now ubiquitous in China. Extra money would help: the couple was stuck in their home village for a month on minimum pay when the virus hit around the lunar new year in 2020. But they long to see their daughter, 15, and son, 12, who live in Henan with grandparents. "My parents are getting old, my kids are still young. If we didn't go back, my heart wouldn't be at ease," says the husband.
A group of older workers from Lingbao county, a poor region of Henan, are bracing themselves for 25 hours on hard seats on a slow train home. Earning just 107 yuan a day at a hardware factory, they have brought buckets of steamed buns and fruit to avoid "expensive" train food. They each paid 75 yuan for a covid test and will need another after self-isolating for a week in their mountain homes. "Making money is hard," sighs one. Yet their precarious status gives them some autonomy, too. Their short-term contracts expired before the holiday, so no boss can make them stay.
At one point, Chaguan hears conflicting views. You in the West call China's travel curbs mandatory but they are just advisory, insists a hotel tout. He asserts that China's Confucian culture means that people like to agree with the government. Another man weighs in, declaring that migrant workers are treated worse than city folk. Moreover, he says, once "advice" from national leaders is enforced by grassroots officials it turns into an order. Abruptly, his indignation subsides. He is going home, unable to bear missing new year with his wife and children. "I have to go back, they are waiting for me to set off the firecrackers," he says simply. The Communist Party seems wary of public anger. On February 3rd it warned local officials not to over-egg virus controls.
The ones staying behind
Away from the station, in a suburb of factories and shabby apartment blocks, many migrants are resigned to a holiday alone. A restaurant owner from the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang reports that most fellow northerners are staying in Guangzhou, for fear of getting stuck by a covid outbreak back home.
In a nearby alley a seller of fake Gucci shoes last saw his children half a year ago. He is not going home to rural Henan, in case he is quarantined for too long and his children miss the start of term in their primary school. His children understand, he says. He has sent them toys and their teachers have told them that "everyone has to tough it out a little this year." Actually, Chinese families are not all experiencing the same tough new year. The migrants at the bottom of the social ladder have it worst. The pandemic is teaching the shoeseller's children this harsh lesson at a young age. As village kids in a crowded country that is better at economic than social mobility, they have more such lessons to come.

摘要: Yanbian is home to fewer than a million members of an officially recognised Korean ethnic minority, most of them descended from migrants who fled wars and famines on the Korean peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Chinese scholars study the region as a model of co-existence with the country's Han majority. Education is part of that story. Ethnic Korean schools in Yanbian have offered bilingual education for more than 60 years. Until recently, classes in maths, science and foreign languages were offered in Mandarin, while Korean was used to teach hard-to-grasp concepts in subjects like history, politics and other social sciences. Now Yanbian finds its education laws under direct assault. On January 20th a powerful body, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the npc Standing Committee, announced that education laws in two unnamed places violate an article of China's constitution that says the state promotes the nationwide use of Mandarin. As first reported by npc Observer, an invaluable blog run by Changhao Wei of Yale University Law School, the only education laws that match the announcement are in Inner Mongolia and Yanbian.

全文文献: Headnote Assimilation of minorities is not just for Uyghurs and Tibetans
SOMETIMES EASY victories are the most revealing. Lots of governments are capable of ruthlessness in the face of terrorism or real threats to national security. When a regime uses its full strength to impose its will on a group offering no resistance, however, that is a clarifying moment. Just such an unequal contest is now unfolding in the forested hills of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, near the Chinese border with North Korea.
Yanbian is home to fewer than a million members of an officially recognised Korean ethnic minority, most of them descended from migrants who fled wars and famines on the Korean peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Chinese scholars study the region as a model of co-existence with the country's Han majority. Education is part of that story. Ethnic Korean schools in Yanbian have offered bilingual education for more than 60 years. Until recently, classes in maths, science and foreign languages were offered in Mandarin, while Korean was used to teach hard-to-grasp concepts in subjects like history, politics and other social sciences.
Traditionally, the urge to learn is strong in Korean culture. "Parents would sell cattle for their children to go to school," says one academic. In this century Yanbian pioneered trilingual education, passing local education laws in 2004 that gave precedence to Korean but placed new weight on teaching students a third language (sometimes Japanese, but mostly English). In a globalised age, parents understand that languages are about more than tradition: they are a bridge to other cultures, says the academic. Multilingual Yanbian graduates are sought after by employers in southern boomtowns such as Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
Yanbian's ethnic Korean schools were for a long time sheltered from a campaign to promote Mandarin over minority languages, which was rolled out a decade ago in such restive spots as Xinjiang and Tibet and has since spread nationwide. Last November a leading member of the National People's Congress (npc) called Mandarin-promotion a crucial policy for "managing ethnic affairs, enhancing national unity and safeguarding national security".
Now Yanbian finds its education laws under direct assault. On January 20th a powerful body, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the npc Standing Committee, announced that education laws in two unnamed places violate an article of China's constitution that says the state promotes the nationwide use of Mandarin. As first reported by npc Observer, an invaluable blog run by Changhao Wei of Yale University Law School, the only education laws that match the announcement are in Inner Mongolia and Yanbian.
The ruling is shocking in several ways. For one thing, it is the bluntest of legal instruments to declare a law unconstitutional. For another, the npc ruling made no mention of another article in the constitution that offers protection for ethnic-minority languages. In reality, those protections are a relic of policies that date back to the founding of Communist China in 1949. Today, the political tide is with prominent scholars and officials who call for "second-generation ethnic policies", built around assimilating minorities into a single, Chinese civilisation. Such nationalists justify their centralising zeal with claims that China risks ethnic unrest and a Soviet-style break-up if minority privileges are not ended.
In Xinjiang education policies are bound up with a larger wave of repression, imposed in the name of counter-terrorism and fighting Islamic extremism. Most foreign attention has been paid to Xinjiang's political re-education camps, through which perhaps a million Muslims from the Uyghur minority have passed, after being flagged as potential extremists for such acts as praying too often or telephoning relatives overseas. But in Xinjiang's ethnicminority schools, life has also been transformed. Formerly, many subjects were taught in the Uyghur and Kazakh languages. Now those tongues have been downgraded from mediums of instruction to mere subjects, offered for a few hours each week. In Tibet and in Tibetan areas of Qinghai, a neighbouring province, similar changes to education policies prompted street protests in 2010. In the late summer of 2020, thousands of parents in Inner Mongolia boycotted schools after it was announced that such sensitive subjects as literature, politics and history must be taught in Mandarin by 2022. Across Inner Mongolia riot police broke up protests, and parents were ordered to send children to school or else be declared ineligible for government subsidies or bank loans.
No riots greeted a similar change to language rules in Yanbian, unveiled as the school year began last September. Today the academic urges patience, encouraging families to wait to see how the government balances the need to strengthen general-purpose education with the task of preserving ethnic languages.
Bad Korea move
Locals encountered in Yanji, the regional capital, on a recent weekday, including parents who had brought children to skate or sled on the frozen Buerhatong river, offered mixed opinions of the change. A Korean-Chinese man with a son at kindergarten supports the greater use of Mandarin in schools. He struggled at university and had to study Chinese in his spare time. He accuses some groups, such as Tibetans, of separatist ambitions. "We Koreans don't feel like that, we're more supportive of the government."
Others are torn. A mother of two toddlers worries that Korean culture may be weakened by the new rules. But there must be a logic to the state's actions, she adds, as locals glide past on chairs fitted with ice-skates, pushing themselves along with spike-tipped poles. The government sees a bigger picture than mere citizens can, suggests the mother, loyally. Such deference to authority is not rewarded with much trust. Plain-clothes police followed Chaguan around Yanji and tried to eavesdrop on interviews.
The fate of Yanbian-a region that finds itself accused of unconstitutional acts-points to a bleak reality for ethnic minorities. Loyalty is not enough. Their duty is to become more Chinese. *

全文文献: Headnote In its 100th year, expect China's Communist Party to sound radical at home and reassuring abroad
In late may 1949, as China's civil war neared a blood-soaked end, America's consul-general in Shanghai, John Cabot, was startled when resident Western businessmen cheered the city's capture by Communist soldiers. Foreign traders and factory bosses admired the discipline of the troops, who declined gifts of food and handed out notices in English promising safety for "normal" businesses.
Blithely discounting the Communists' pro-Soviet, anti-imperialist rhetoric, the Westerners focused on the party's stated mission to save the country from hunger and want. That would surely involve trade with the West, and thus them. At the American Chamber of Commerce a day after Shanghai's takeover, Cabot found members convinced that they would thrive under Communist rule. "The rejoicing couldn't have been greater if the city had been liberated by American forces," the diplomat recorded drily. "I can't think why." He was right to be cynical. Before long Western businessmen were begging to sell assets and pleading for exit permits.
Scenes of wishful thinking fill an excellent new book about the founding year of the People's Republic, "China 1949: Year of Revolution" by Graham Hutchings. Those delusions were carefully nurtured by the Communist Party. Westerners were told, in effect, that economics would trump ideology. Chinese tycoons were assured by Mao that he planned to restrain, not abolish, capitalism. Several stayed. The luckiest endured only the nationalisation of their firms in the mid-1950s. Later, others were persecuted to death.
Back in 1949 this quelling of panic among the outgoing elites involved deft rhetorical conjuring by Mao and party leaders. For even as they downplayed their radicalism when addressing the old establishment, they successfully wooed ordinary Chinese with visions of transformation and revolution. Peasants were recruited to Communist armies with promises of land after the war, when rural property-owners would be destroyed as a class. Urban workers were led to expect liberation from exploitative bosses. Intellectuals and students were urged to help to build a modern country and end centuries of humiliation by foreign powers. Somehow the party managed to sell these two competing stories at the same time. One group found no place in either narrative, Mr Hutchings shrewdly notes. Liberal Chinese intellectuals, lawyers and journalists were losers in 1949, because their attachment to individual rights and accountable government amounted to a creed of opposition. Mao had no tolerance for dissent, even from loyal patriots. Declaring China in need of salvation from domestic and external foes, the party's response involved strong, even iron-fisted, rule.
Jump to 2021, the centenary of the party's founding, and China's rulers face a revealingly similar challenge. Once again, they must tell two, contradictory stories about their country and its future. The first will be soothing. After four years of open competition with the Trump administration, involving tariff wars, tit-for-tat visa fights and barriers to trade in sensitive technologies, China would like to call a truce. Its rulers will ask to revive old economic dialogues and to seek new avenues for co-operation with President Joe Biden, in such fields as climate change or pandemic control. They have no illusions about returning to the days when American leaders actively welcomed China's rise. Still, in part to buy time while they seek greater self-reliance, Chinese leaders will portray their country as a source of stability and economic growth. China last year agreed two modest trade agreements, one with 14 Pacific neighbours and a second with the European Union. Its paramount leader, Xi Jinping, has suggested that China may join the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, a more ambitious trade pact that was proposed by America under Barack Obama, but which Donald Trump snubbed. In private, Chinese elites insist that Western critics mistakenly view their country as a threat because it is run by a Communist Party. They say the party is more pragmatic than ideological, with a doctrine that resembles a mishmash of nationalism, traditional Chinese culture and a vaguely leftish belief that capitalists, while good at innovation, should pay more heed to the national interest and not flaunt their wealth.
Talking about a revolution, just not to foreigners
The headache for China's leaders is that they must tell a different, intensely political, story to domestic audiences, as their party turns 100 in July. To inspire the masses and guide the work of officials, leaders must explain their vaulting ambitions for the country and the centrality of the party to them. They have already begun. On January 11th Mr Xi declared that China was entering a "new development stage", having achieved a first centennial goal of building a "moderately prosperous society". China's new goal is to be a "great modern socialist country" by 2049, when the People's Republic turns 100. In plainer language, China wants to be a superpower of unchallenged strength and influence.
In 1949 the party won power with offers of domestic redistribution. Today, the promise involves a global redistribution of wealth and geopolitical clout. On January 15th a senior security official, Chen Yixin, told colleagues that the great trend of the moment was "a rising East and a declining West". China has much to gain, he declared, if it can manage a protracted struggle with America and public-security risks at home. Once again liberals will be losers, for there is no room in Mr Xi's China for checks and balances on an allpowerful, all-controlling party and state.
China's smoothest envoys will spend 2021 assuring foreigners that these are slogans about long-term ambitions, and should not be taken literally. That is too glib. The world should take seriously Mr Xi's talk of China "becoming strong", after a period of "standing up" (a reference to nation-building under Mao), and decades of "getting rich" (a nod to market reforms unleashed by Deng Xiaoping). In China, leaders' speeches are not mere words. They are political marching orders. A turbulent year looms. *

全文文献: Headnote A year into the pandemic, ordinary Chinese are strikingly accepting of harsh virus controls
ON JANUARY 10th an office worker surnamed Zhou was diagnosed with covid-19 in Xicheng, a district of Beijing. For officials under orders to keep the virus out of China's capital, this single case was grim, career-threatening news. They responded with a vigour that some other countries reserve for wartime invasions. As is the norm when anyone in China tests positive, Ms Zhou's movements for the previous ten days were made public, down to noodle bars where she ate and train lines that she took. Internet users fumed that she had twice visited Shijiazhuang, a drab city of 11m people in the next-door province of Hebei, which has seen more than 400 virus cases since the new year. She should have stayed at home, or at least avoided the metro, netizens growled.
Almost 100 of Ms Zhou's close contacts and thousands of workers near her office were swiftly tested. Authorities tested and quarantined her neighbours in Gu'an, a Beijing commuter town just inside Hebei. On January 12th officials took still sterner measures. Roads out of Gu'an were sealed and 500,000 residents told to quarantine for a week. Several cities in Hebei province, including Shijiazhuang, its capital, have been locked down to quell outbreaks. Some 22m people have been trapped at home.
In Beijing, growing fears of a second wave have led to evertighter rules. These range from the irritating-some pharmacies stopping over-the-counter painkiller sales, to prevent people hiding fevers-to the heartbreaking. Chinese New Year, which this year falls on February 12th, has been, in effect, cancelled for government workers: they may not travel home to see families around China. Almost every movement in the city must be registered by scanning a health code with a smartphone, whether visiting a shop or catching a taxi. After commuters spent hours snarled at highway checkpoints into the capital, social media described inventive workers skating down rivers frozen by the coldest winter in years. New rules duly banned skating into Beijing.
Such restrictions are burdensome, indeed a bit sinister, but effective. At the time of writing, Beijing has detected 44 cases of covid in the past month, after millions of tests. For comparison, London is finding more than 8,500 new cases a day. Foreign chaos prompts head-shaking disbelief from Chinese, who ask if it is true that some Westerners refuse to wear face masks. China's strict virus controls are rarely criticised, even in private. Indeed, a common grumble is that rules are not being enforced harshly enough.
A lazy explanation for this virus exceptionalism is that people in China do not care about personal freedoms or privacy. That is unfair to citizens of a large country with complicated views towards authority. Instead, a year into this pandemic, a simpler difference stands out. Lots of ordinary Chinese take covid-19 seriously in a way that is not always true in the West. In particular, the idea of catching it inspires real fear, even dread. The reasons include politics and propaganda, economics, culture and history.
Intrusive virus controls have their own, self-reinforcing logic. In China, each individual case disrupts many lives. Beijing's worst outbreak to date started in a wholesale food market last summer, infecting at least 368 people. Its first officially diagnosed patient, on June 11th, was Tang Jingzhi, the owner of a noodle shop. Interviewed this week on a stroll through his local park, Mr Tang, an amiable 52-year-old Beijinger, recalls how he reported a low-grade fever to local doctors, only to be called back later that night. "When I arrived the fever clinic was sealed off, all the doors and gates were closed and they greeted me in protective suits."
Weeks of treatment followed. Chinese netizens spread false rumours that he had visited an infected city in the north and had covered his tracks by using an unregistered smartphone. Happily, doctors and virus-control officers confirmed that he had fallen ill after buying salmon for his ten-year-old son at the market in Beijing. Still, his restaurant was closed for two months, leaving him to pay staff salaries from savings. His wife and son were quarantined for three weeks, then avoided friends until school started in September, fearing their reactions. State media commended Mr Tang for reporting his illness, easing his return to society. He praises China's government for its virus control and "cannot fathom" Western responses to covid-19. In China, people understand that society is safe only when all play their part, he says: "If I am irresponsible and harm other people, it may come full circle and hurt me." China is an ageing society and not yet rich, he adds. Serious illness is feared because it can cause financial ruin.
In China, shame is a powerful tool
A prominent psychologist, Lu Lin, reports that a study of 1,000 covid patients found about a third suffering from depression and anxiety long after recovery. Research continues into the precise role played by social stigma and discrimination, says Professor Lu, the president of Peking University Sixth Hospital. But he cites reallife cases, such as that of an old woman who was excluded from a dancing club even after she had shaken off the virus. Some social pressure can be useful. "For young people, you should not think just of yourself, you should think of your community," he says.
Official media have played up the deadly nature of covid-19, while striving to erase memories of disastrous early cover-ups in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. In part, propaganda chiefs want to demonstrate the superiority of modern Communist Party rule. In part, they are drawing on older traditions. An outbreak of bubonic plague during the civil war in 1947 saw party workers in the north-east recruit villagers with a "patriotic hygiene" campaign involving compulsory vaccinations and fines for failing to report deaths. Further back, in the last days of the Qing dynasty, reformist officials fighting plague in Manchuria in 1910-11 linked modern medicine with national rejuvenation, stressing the need to quarantine "irresponsible" migrant workers and make them wear face masks. In China, the urge to control has deep roots.

全文文献: Headnote Weary cynicism, not naivety, explains a flawed new EU-China commercial pact
Buoyed by a growing economy, cheered by a domestic public united by the fight against covid-19, and eager to start shipping vaccines to friends around the world, China's rulers feel history turning their way. A recurring phrase in their speeches hails "changes unseen in a hundred years". Bluntly, Communist Party chiefs feel China is rising and democratic countries-battered by recession and racked by partisan disputes-are falling behind.
As 2021 dawned, the European Union offered China a further boost by agreeing to a commercial pact that will bind some powerful European companies still more tightly to China. The deal brushes aside concerns about dependence on Chinese markets. It tackles allegations of forced labour in supply chains by accepting promises that China will make "continued and sustained efforts" to ratify international conventions on workers' rights.
Politically, China sees the deal-a comprehensive investment agreement whose benefits mostly flow to a few German carmakers, European insurance companies and other well-connected firms-as an early victory over Joe Biden. Aides to America's president-elect had hinted publicly that Europe might like to wait and co-ordinate efforts to curb China's worst trade and human-rights abuses. Those hints were ignored. Hosting eu ambassadors for lunch just before Christmas, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, praised Europe's "strategic autonomy". The phrase was first dreamed up by French politicians. Mr Wang's use of it sent a clear message. As envoys at the lunch tell it, China was thanking the agreement's main backers, notably Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, for refusing to join America in the one alliance that Chinese leaders fear: a global coalition of like-minded nations willing to exclude China from sensitive supply chains or to block investments, in defence of democratic norms and freedoms.
Critics accuse eu leaders of shocking naivety. They were particularly dismayed when the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, claimed that the agreement promoted Europe's "core values", and that China's vague commitments provided "a lever to eradicate forced labour". Actually, it is not fair to call European leaders naive about the investment accord. Rather, their motives are a mix of self-interest, cynicism about Europe's limited clout and pessimism about the prospects for joint action with Mr Biden's America. A European summarises the decision-making process: "We had an economic interest in concluding a deal. The Chinese had a political interest in demonstrating that China is not isolated. There was a perception we would get nothing more."
Views among European ambassadors and business bosses in China have hardened noticeably as the country takes one illiberal turn after another under President Xi Jinping, an austere autocrat. In particular, 2020 was a turning-point. A new national-security law trampled on Hong Kong's Western-style freedoms. Chinese troops killed Indian soldiers in a border clash. Intent on smothering discussions of China's disastrous early handling of covid-19, Chinese diplomats threatened governments across the West, and were praised at home as patriotic "wolf warriors". China banned many Australian imports to punish that country for suggesting an independent probe into the pandemic's origins.
Early in 2019 the eu published a strikingly honest China strategy, calling the country a partner, a competitor but also a "systemic rival". Among Europeans charged with managing relations with China, that tripartite view of China has not changed. The investment agreement is best understood as a holdover from a time when Europe was unwilling to acknowledge deep ideological differences with China. The eu's negotiating mandate for the deal dates from 2013. With its focus on market access and level playing fields, it sets out to manage China as a partner and competitor, says Reinhard Bütikofer, a German Green and chairman of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with China. "It almost completely ignores systemic rivalry," he objects, speaking by Zoom from Berlin. He expects the parliament, which must approve the pact, to seek stronger commitments on labour rights, notably in factories using workers from Xinjiang, a western region where Muslim minorities are governed with an iron fist.
Mr Bütikofer's approach is increasingly popular among Western elected politicians. It is a minority view among European bigwigs in China. Most argue for trade talks that seek whatever concessions are going, then for separate efforts to press China into curbing its worst abuses, and, most important, for work at home on anti-subsidy measures and security-screening of investments.
China is not about to change: time to build better defences
Chinese voices insist that clashes over values are not inevitable, at least when talking to foreigners. Wang Yiwei, director of the eu studies centre at Renmin University, chides Americans for thinking like religious missionaries about engagement with China. In contrast, "Europe is secular; it is not seeking to convert China to a multiparty system or a free press," he asserts, approvingly.
European sources in Beijing ascribe China's willingness to cut a deal, after much foot-dragging, to two factors. First, to the belief of Liu He, a deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy, that some European competition is good for state-owned firms. Second, to a decision by Mr Xi to do a deal before Mr Biden takes office.
Ask European envoys if the eu erred by agreeing to a deal now, and they are divided. Some insist that Europe risked irrelevance if it had waited for a new American president. They add that this modest accord does not preclude co-ordinated action later. Others regret the decision to hand China a political win at Mr Biden's expense. Not one of the diplomats argues that Europe underestimated its leverage, and could have struck a better deal. Among Westerners in Beijing, bleak realism predominates. Mr Biden says he will rally the democratic world behind a new China strategy. He has his work cut out. *

摘要: An analysis of satellite images published in September 2020 by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a research group, estimates that over 8,000 mosques have been destroyed. The city's old town has been largely rebuilt since 2009, with adobe-walled alleys levelled to create earthquake-proof, tourist-friendly streets lined with kebab stalls and handicrafts shops. An unscientific survey of the old town found six mosques locked shut, with dead leaves and other debris littering their courtyards.

全文文献: Headnote How China uses mass tourism to stifle Xinjiang's religious and cultural traditions
THE AFAQ KHOJA mausoleum in Kashgar is one of the holiest places in Xinjiang, a region in the far west of China. The site is politically charged, too. Several 19th-century uprisings against Chinese rule began with rebels making a pilgrimage to the shrine, and its tomb of Afaq Khoja, a divisive figure revered by some locals as a Sufi Muslim saint, and scorned by others as a traitor. It is beautiful, with stately domes and minarets rendered as exquisite as a jewel box by tiles of green, blue, yellow and brown. To one side lies an ancient cemetery fringed with poplar trees. Its mud and brick tombs were capped with snow when Chaguan visited. As remote as it is lovely, the shrine lies closer to Baghdad than to Beijing.
Not all Muslim sites are as protected. In recent years China has worked to stamp out any hint of religious fervour in Xinjiang. Perhaps a million of the region's ethnic-Uyghurs have been accused of radical Islamic thinking and sent to re-education camps. Domes and minarets, deemed an "Arabic" import, have been removed from many buildings. An analysis of satellite images published in September 2020 by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a research group, estimates that over 8,000 mosques have been destroyed. That is one-third of all those recorded in Xinjiang by a census in 2004. Xinjiang's government insists that it has never "forcibly demolished" religious sites, and has merely improved old mosques that were unsafe in earthquakes or heavy rain, or "poorly laid-out". The claim is not hard to disprove. In the oasis city of Hotan, Chaguan saw the bare ground where the small Gulluk Kowruk mosque stood, and visited the corner of Wenhua and Taibei Roads, from which a larger mosque has simply vanished.
Officials have not demolished the Afaq Khoja shrine. Instead they are trying to neutralise its power as a place so sacred that pilgrims would collect dust from its grounds. Their tool: mass tourism by China's ethnic-Han majority. Their method is to link the site to Xiang Fei, or the "Fragrant Concubine". She was a Kashgar woman who, according to Chinese legend, enraptured the 18thcentury Qianlong emperor with her mysterious natural scent, after being captured and delivered to his harem. Her story appeared in print in 1892 and inspired poems, operas and a television drama in the 1990s. Early accounts call Xiang Fei the wife (or daughter) of a descendant of Afaq Khoja. Drawing on Chinese traditions venerating chaste widows, they describe her resistance to the emperor, whom she planned to stab with tiny daggers hidden in her sleeves, and her death by execution. Anxious to promote ethnic unity, Communist-era writers insist that she loved the emperor and died of illness. For decades a sign has marked her supposed tomb at the Afaq Khoja shrine. Imperial archives record a simpler tale: a Kashgar woman who became the emperor's consort and is buried near Beijing, notes Rian Thum of Loyola University in New Orleans, in his book "The Sacred Routes of Uyghur History".
Unfussed by historical details, officials opened a tourist park called Xiang Fei Garden in 2015. At its far northern end lies the mausoleum, relabelled "Fragrant Imperial Concubine's Tomb". Signs point tour groups towards Uyghur folk-dance shows and praise "soft and humble" Xiang Fei. Her purported love for China's emperor is called a symbol of "the reunification of the motherland". Pilgrims are discouraged by the gates and guards that surround public buildings in Xinjiang. Outside the shrine's perimeter, Chaguan saw an old man scooping dust into a bag, but did not ask why. It is unsafe for Uyghurs to speak to foreign reporters. The same unmarked Volkswagen followed your columnist all day.
It is not just mass tourism that is changing Kashgar. The city's old town has been largely rebuilt since 2009, with adobe-walled alleys levelled to create earthquake-proof, tourist-friendly streets lined with kebab stalls and handicrafts shops. A more recent trend has seen an influx of Han hipsters and artistic types bent on turning Uyghur traditions into profit. Oppressive security, involving cameras and police checkpoints at every turn, does not deter them.
Chaguan met a young photographer from Dali, a city in southern China, taking wedding pictures of a Han couple in Uyghur robes. The couple wanted a "special ethnic look", his helper explained. Nearby, on Baishiairike Alley, a café called Zebra Commune was opened in 2019 by a couple from the south-western city of Chengdu. A post on Dianping, a review website, enthuses: "I'm so pleased a shop is finally doing southern Xinjiang culture right." In a video blog the co-founder, Wang Li (who prefers the name Mrs Zebra), shows off herbal teas sold in the café's carpet-bedecked halls, as well as a narrow tower she calls her little secret place. More jarringly, a posting by her husband, "Mr Zebra", admits that, when they first arrived, bicycles outside their café had tyres slashed, and excrement was left on their steps. He ascribes this to "misunderstandings" caused by "the unique nature of the space".
A colony by any other name
That is an understatement. Zebra Commune is a former mosque, its quaint tower a minaret with its crescent moon knocked off. Photographs from 2014 show a bustling place of worship, with a dozen people praying on rugs outside. The café recently closed, prompting dismay from a Kashgar official who praised the couple online for investing so much work in the business. Another exmosque, in Areya Road, was a bar until it closed in October, hit by a covid-induced lull in tourism. Online, Chinese travellers praise its generous measures of alcohol. A public lavatory, labelled "Tourist Toilet", fills much of the ground floor.
Asked where a prayer service might be found, a man named the city's largest mosque, the Idh Kah, then hurried off. An unscientific survey of the old town found six mosques locked shut, with dead leaves and other debris littering their courtyards. Several had lost domes, minarets and crescent moons. Strolling tourists could easily miss their former purpose. Many might not care. To smother a culture, it turns out, tour buses are as effective as bulldozers. *

全文文献: Headnote Chaguan pays an uninvited visit to a factory complex accused of using forced Uyghur labour
Avast expanse of sand dunes, studded with the wind-eroded ruins of lost Silk Road cities, the Taklamakan Desert is a fine place to hide a guilty secret. At first glance, shame is a plausible explanation for a mini construction-boom under way in this remote corner of Xinjiang. For outsiders are increasingly shocked by China's rule over this north-western region, where millions of Uyghurs, an ethnic minority, endure oppressive, high-tech surveillance and the constant fear of detention for alleged Islamic extremism.
For the past few years overseas human-rights groups and scholars have used satellite images and Chinese government documents to track dozens of factories rising on the Taklamakan's southern edge in Lop County, a poor and almost entirely Uyghur area. The factories line the newly laid streets of an industrial park sponsored by the city of Beijing, 4,000km to the east. More alarmingly, satellite images and the Xinjiang government's own propaganda suggest that as the park rose from the desert sands, at least one political re-education camp lurked amid the factories.
Across Xinjiang over a million Uyghurs have passed through such camps in recent years. Officials eventually admitted to the camps' existence in 2018. Pointing to terrorist attacks by Muslims from Xinjiang, they said China had set up vocational training centres to cure minds infected with religious extremism. In October 2018 China Central Television toured a camp in Hotan, an ancient oasis city. Detainees were shown in Mandarin-language classes, studying Chinese laws and learning such skills as sewing, before thanking authorities for saving them. In contrast, critics call the campaign both brutal in its methods and horrifyingly arbitrary in its application. Leaked government files record Uyghurs interned for such "suspicious" acts as growing long beards, applying for a passport or using foreign messaging services like Skype. Ex-detainees have accused camp staff of beatings and rapes.
Now this giant social-engineering project is evolving. In late 2019 officials said that all detainees have graduated from compulsory studies. On a recent weekend Chaguan visited the Hotan city camp toured by state television and found it apparently abandoned, observed only by a clutch of camels and locals digging for white jade in a dried-up riverbed. Closing highly visible sites signals shifting tactics, not a change of heart. China is merging counter-terrorism work in Xinjiang with nationwide campaigns to assimilate ethnic minorities and push the rural poor into formal employment, in the name of development and social stability. A State Council white paper from September, detailing training and job placement campaigns in Xinjiang, found 2.6m "rural surplus workers" in the region, notably Uyghurs with "outdated ideas".
Hints of trouble abound. The white paper blames "terrorists, separatists and religious extremists" for inciting locals to "refuse to improve their vocational skills". Global firms that audit multinational supply chains for labour abuses increasingly decline to operate in Xinjiang, blaming authorities for obstructing their work. Earlier this year the American government said that it suspects several businesses in Lop County of using forced labour, specifically firms trading in human hair. American customs officers seized tonnes of wigs and hairpieces in June, then afterwards banned all hair imports from the Lop County Hair Products Industrial Park, a zone within the Beijing Industrial Park. Chinese government spokesmen and state media dismiss talk of forced labour as a smear by Westerners bent on keeping China down.
To an optimist, such shrill denials might suggest that sanctions are biting. Xinjiang has a lot to lose: it supplies almost a fifth of the world's cotton, among other commodities. Your columnist, who is not generally an optimist, headed to Lop County to take a look in person. Chaguan travelled with a reporter from another Western newspaper. As happens in Xinjiang, police were already waiting for the foreign journalists at Hotan, the nearest airport to Lop County. An hour later, goons blocked an access road to the industrial park, turning Chaguan's taxi away. He and his colleague finally arrived on foot after a long desert walk around the park boundary, a metal fence topped with four strands of electrified wire.
Defiance in the desert
American sanctions have yet to paralyse Lop County's factories, it can be reported. On a freezing but sunny weekend morning, the entrance to the hair-products park was busy with traffic. Nearby, construction workers toiled on new buildings. The arrival of foreign reporters triggered bouts of pushing and arm-grabbing by unidentified men bent on stopping the Westerners from proceeding further, one of whom called himself "the person responsible for the park". Trying to grab reporters' smartphones, they demanded the deletion of pictures of their industrial zone and of what appears to be a training facility at the park's southern end, resembling a secure boarding school, down to young adults lined up in rows on a playing field. Questions were greeted with evasions. "We don't really have dealings with the outside world," replied one of the men when asked about American sanctions. Initially asserting that his company only sells to domestic markets, he then claimed that it makes nothing at all and "is still being put together".
The men staged one more physical confrontation when a hulking, prison-like complex with tall grey walls and guard towers came into view. Failing to stop the foreigners from seeing the prison, they focused on preventing photography.
Still, evidence-destruction is not a sign of a sore conscience. Bits of the park designed to be seen from the ground by locals are unapologetic. Giant rooftop characters in the training facility spell out such slogans as: "Labour is glorious" and "Serve the economy". A poster by the main gate shows President Xi Jinping surrounded by smiling Uyghur children. China's regime is secretive because it has no patience for debating its policies with foreigners. It is proud of its iron-fisted rule in Xinjiang, and is not about to change.

全文文献: Headnote China's habit of humiliating those who defy it could backfire
China bullies other countries because it works. Once told that they have crossed a "red line" by harming China's interests or calling out its misdeeds, many governments crumble swiftly. Others fold after suffering months of threats, trade boycotts and cancelled official meetings. But in China's long experience, almost all-even sometimes America-climb down eventually, sending envoys to sue for peace. True, some Western leaders pay public lipservice to their own country's values as they land in far-off Beijing. Once the press is shooed from the room, however, the foreign visitors get down to dealmaking. They bow to China's mix of market power, geopolitical importance and ruthlessness.
Lately, bullying others into furtive submission has not been enough for Communist Party chiefs. Increasingly, they seem bent on humiliating countries that show defiance, notably small or mid-sized allies of America. Just now, it is Australia's turn for punishment. Its transgressions include taking a lead among American allies in banning the use of 5G network equipment from Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant, and calling for an independent probe into the origins of covid-19. China has imposed hefty tariffs on Australian wine and blocked imports of everything from coal to lobsters. In November Chinese diplomats made public a list of 14 ways in which Australia was "poisoning bilateral relations". The charge-sheet rebuked Australia for allowing news outlets, members of parliament and think-tanks to criticise China. Late last month China's foreign ministry pounced on an Australian government report into unlawful, brutal killings of prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan by Australian troops. Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman and licensed provocateur on social media, said the report exposed the hypocrisy of Western concerns about human rights. On November 30th Mr Zhao tweeted a crude photomontage made to look like an Australian soldier slitting an Afghan child's throat. Mr Zhao demanded that troops be held accountable-serenely ignoring the fact that Australia's inquiry had already recommended that 19 soldiers face criminal investigation.
At first sight, such Chinese provocations look clumsy, indeed self-defeating. By offending lots of ordinary Australians, they complicate life for those businesspeople and politicians who want their government to placate China in hopes of restoring normal, profitable trade flows. That underestimates the calculating nature of Mr Zhao's tweets and other Chinese attacks, which are not intended to win over Australian hearts and minds. Their aim is partly domestic: to demonstrate the foreign ministry's fighting spirit to Chinese leaders and online nationalists. The intention is also to demonstrate China's strength and to provoke such a sense of crisis that Australian political and business leaders are desperate to seek a truce. China's outlandish attacks are pseudo-populism: a calculated ploy to press elites into cutting a deal.
China may yet feel vindicated in its choice of tactics. Australia may cave. If it does not, and China decides to sacrifice relations with Australia for years to come, a ghastly warning will be sent to other trade partners that imagine they can criticise China with impunity. The world is a rough place on the eve of 2021. China feels in better shape than most. While other large economies remain battered by covid-19, it has already returned to growth. When enunciating their core national interests, Chinese leaders are at least predictable. In contrast, America's allies have spent four years absorbing hard lessons about the impermanence of American interests that once seemed carved in stone-lessons that will outlive the Trump presidency.
Yet conversations in recent weeks with more than a dozen ambassadors in Beijing reveal a striking change of mood. Westerners know that they often struggle to understand the incentives that guide Chinese officials. But envoys in Beijing increasingly suspect that China's rulers are misreading the mood in democracies. In particular, Communist Party bosses are too disdainful of Western public opinion, which is swinging against China in ways that will constrain governments, at least somewhat, as they strive to balance economic interests and democratic values.
China prefers to be admired, but will settle for fear
Western unity is too fragile to enable many formal displays of solidarity with Australia. And multinational corporations are not about to leave China. For lots of big firms, their only profitable business unit this year is Chinese. But China's assertiveness abroad, and its hardline ideological turn at home, are creating political uncertainties that businesses cannot ignore. The talk is of hedging now, and of diversifying future investments. There will be no binary moment when the West switches from engagement to decoupling. However, China is teaching the West to be more defensive. Over time, more individual, seemingly unconnected decisions will be a no, not a yes: whether to allow this Chinese investment, buy that sensitive technology from a Chinese firm, or sign an exchange deal with a Chinese university. That could have surprising cumulative effects. Western defensiveness will not stop China from rising, but it could alter China's trajectory, perhaps steering it towards dominance of only part of the world: a technoauthoritarian sphere in tension with a more liberal bloc.
For decades, countries have tolerated Chinese bullying. For that, thank pragmatism, naivety and cynicism among politicians and business bosses, and broad indifference among publics. Now, however, China seems bent on changing countries that it deems hostile, so that governments, news outlets, universities and other institutions never defy China again. Some trade partners, especially in China's backyard, will feel bound to submit. Others may prove more stubborn. China is no longer just a foreign-policy puzzle. As its confidence swells, and its technological footprint grows, it is ready to challenge how Western societies work at home. Imposing that sort of humiliation comes with costs.

全文文献: Headnote The first lesson of doing business in China is that the state comes first
Four decades after China emerged from Maoist isolation, mystery surrounds some big questions about its rulers' views of the world. Start with a topical one: what are the true feelings of China's leader, President Xi Jinping, towards Western-style shareholder capitalism, with its emphasis on free competition, transparency, separation between ownership and management, and oversight by impartial regulators and courts?
Listen to speeches aimed at foreign audiences, and China is an example to the capitalist world. It is presented as a champion of openness and fair play, defending free trade against populist nationalists who have fantasies of turning back the forces of globalisation. Yet at home Mr Xi spends as much time stressing national self-reliance, urging Chinese firms, officials and scientists to end their country's dependence on foreign technologies.
Fresh confusion was caused when the government abruptly suspended what was expected to be the largest stockmarket flotation in history, early in November. That ipo by Ant, a financialtechnology giant, collapsed after its founder, Jack Ma, publicly grumbled about cautious regulators and small-minded banks. In China, many sensed a warning from the government that even billionaires must defer to the party. On November 12th Mr Xi sent another message. He visited the eastern city of Nantong to hail a local industrialist, Zhang Jian, as a patriotic entrepreneur whose life story, from 1853-1926, should be studied by business bosses. Touring the mansion that Zhang called home, Mr Xi praised the scholar-turned-businessman for building a manufacturing empire, as well as founding schools and China's first museum. When private entrepreneurs get rich they should become wise and socially responsible, Mr Xi said. He instructed that the site become a base for patriotic education.
It is worth listening whenever a secretive regime reveals what it values. On a damp, grey morning this week that hunch took Chaguan to Zhang's gloomy, allegedly "British-style" mansion in Nantong, to retrace Mr Xi's steps. Downstairs, he found a delegation of Communist Party members from the Nantong city government. They were filming their own visit for later study. In an antiquefilled room upstairs, a local man, Zhang Yuanxin, did not hesitate when asked what lesson he took away from Mr Xi's praise for patriotic entrepreneurs. A lot of business types think only about money, he explained. Now it is time for them to give back to society.
A retired engineer from a state-owned oil company, Wang Yongjian, gazed at a bronze bust of the mansion's owner. He noted that Zhang had passed imperial examinations with such distinction that, in another age, he could have served alongside an emperor. But instead, watching China's agonies in the late 19th century, the scholar-official plunged into business. Mr Wang compared Zhang to British inventors of the first steam engines and to Henry Ford, a pioneering American carmaker.
In reality, Zhang created little that was really new. Instead he imported and copied British looms, Dutch irrigation systems and Japanese salt-making techniques, in a bid to fight off foreign competitors. Revealingly, the exhibition in Nantong does not conceal any of this. Displays trace the entrepreneur's journey from scholar-official, serene in mandarin's robes, to indignant nationalist. A diary entry records Zhang's anger at a treaty, imposed on China after its defeat in the first Sino-Japanese war, which allowed foreign firms to open manufacturing plants in the country. Zhang vows to go into industry himself to save China. Another display shows the steamships that he bought to end the shameful domination of Chinese inland waterways by foreign shipping companies. The dizzying list of businesses founded by Zhang includes cotton mills, steel mills, a bakery, a distillery and a bus company. Institutions he founded include libraries, orphanages, a boy's school (motto: "Honesty, Loyalty, Independence, Hard Work") and a school for girls (motto: "Domesticity, Obedience, Thrift, Gentleness"). The exhibition is strikingly incurious about the funding for this empire, beyond faded photographs of supportive officials and images of share certificates. Luckily, Zhang's conglomerate has been thoroughly studied by historians, among them William Goetzmann and Elisabeth Köll. Their paper in 2005 for the National Bureau of Economic Research, "The History of Corporate Ownership in China: State Patronage, Company Legislation, and the Issue of Control", describes a cautionary tale.
Serve the state, and the state will keep competition at bay
Government officials asked Zhang to launch his business in 1895 as a guandu shangban, or government-supervised, merchant-managed enterprise. These firms were modelled on Qing dynasty arrangements by which merchants were granted monopolies, for example in salt-trading, in exchange for collecting taxes and making donations to the emperor to pay for military expeditions or disaster relief. Even after China passed a company law in 1904 and Zhang's conglomerate became a stockholding firm, he ran it as a paternalist autocrat. His first company meeting, in 1907, saw minority shareholders protest that donations to build schools should come from his own funds, not the firm's profits. Think of your consciences, Zhang loftily retorted, ignoring them.
Neither fully capitalist nor state-owned, Zhang's business empire was financed by equity capital but existed to serve the country. That gives Zhang enduring appeal for China's leaders. Long before Mr Xi praised him, Mao Zedong called him one of four Chinese industrialists who should never be forgotten. Objectively, Zhang was not such a successful capitalist. Having narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 1922, he was removed two years later as the company's head by a consortium of banks. His first external audit had revealed an opaque mess of transfers and loans to ailing subsidiaries. Today, he is a model patriot. Modern Chinese entrepreneurs may draw their own conclusions.

摘要: Worse, should Mr Biden urge China's president, Xi Jinping, to join America in imposing crippling new sanctions on North Korea unless it abandons nuclear weapons, the near-consensus among Chinese scholars and foreign diplomats in Beijing is that Mr Xi will refuse. China notes that North Korea returned the remains of long-lost American servicemen, destroyed some nuclear test facilities and that it has refrained from testing long-range missiles and nuclear devices since 2018. Chinese leaders "really believe that because of cold-war thinking, the us never trusted North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons," so never dropped any sanctions in response to North Korean concessions, he says.

全文文献: Headnote Afresh crisis over North Korea will reveal the limits of China's willingness to co-operate with America
OPTIMISTS ABOUT American relations with China should consider the following scenario. At some point in early 2021, perhaps as President Joe Biden is sworn into office, hand on Bible, North Korea sees an incentive in testing a potent new weapon. In a worst case, that may mean launching one of the monstrous intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) that it unveiled at a parade in Pyongyang in October. Each may be able to carry enough nuclear warheads to overwhelm anti-missile defence systems.
The military implications of an icbm test would be bad. The political fallout would be worse. With its first breath China, North Korea's indispensable patron and protector, may condemn the regime in Pyongyang for a reckless act, carried out in defiance of resolutions by the un Security Council. China may note that it is obliged to enforce un sanctions, hinting at a clampdown on (currently rampant) Chinese smuggling of oil into North Korea, and sanctions-busting by North Korea with its exports of coal and the sale of fishing rights. Alas, in its next breath China would probably opine that-if North Korea feels a need to test advanced weapons, or simply to attract the world's attention-America has itself to blame. For it was America, China would insist, that churlishly rejected peace offers made by North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, during his meetings with Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019. Worse, should Mr Biden urge China's president, Xi Jinping, to join America in imposing crippling new sanctions on North Korea unless it abandons nuclear weapons, the near-consensus among Chinese scholars and foreign diplomats in Beijing is that Mr Xi will refuse.
China and America disagree about so much, nowadays, that divergent views of North Korea may seem an afterthought. But seen from Beijing, this gulf in understanding over Korea is unusually revealing, and troubling. In essence, Mr Kim's nuclear ambitions are a nuisance for China. But in the risk-calculations of Chinese leaders, the collapse of the grim, impoverished North Korean regime is a far more alarming prospect. It could lead to a rapid, chaotic reunification with South Korea, an advanced democracy and treaty ally of America which keeps more than 20,000 troops there. Still more cynically, as an Asian diplomat puts it, China does not think that it is the target of North Korea's nukes.
Chinese officials stress the generosity of North Korea's moves to reduce tensions since the crisis of late 2017 and early 2018. That flare-up involved repeated missile tests and nuclear blasts by the Kim regime, prompting Mr Trump first to threaten to rain "fire and fury" on North Korea, and then to pivot abruptly to an approach based on personal diplomacy with Mr Kim. China notes that North Korea returned the remains of long-lost American servicemen, destroyed some nuclear test facilities and that it has refrained from testing long-range missiles and nuclear devices since 2018.
No matter that American officials call North Korea's offers inadequate. China blames America for a diplomatic stalemate since the Trump-Kim summit in Hanoi ended without a deal in February 2019. This is more than a talking point, insists Li Nan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research institute. Chinese leaders "really believe that because of cold-war thinking, the us never trusted North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons," so never dropped any sanctions in response to North Korean concessions, he says. Before fears of covid-19 prompted North Korea to seal its borders, Mr Li was a frequent, well-connected visitor to Pyongyang. He is pessimistic about substantive SinoAmerican co-operation during any fresh Korean crisis. "America can't make concessions to North Korea, and China can't put more pressure on North Korea," is his blunt assessment.
Hardline Chinese nationalists see a conspiracy in America's rejection of North Korean demands. These include dropping sanctions and ending American military exercises with South Korea that Mr Trump calls expensive and provocative, and has suspended. Some Chinese scholars write that their country must face the reality of a nuclear-armed North Korea and balance its geopolitical interests accordingly, says Zhao Tong, a disarmament expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing. To such scholars, progress towards peace is blocked by America's refusal to offer North Korea economic and security incentives. Their explanation is that America does not want to leave the peninsula "because the long-term us goal is to contain China," reports Mr Zhao.
American experts on Korea are just as sceptical about China's motives. Jung Pak is a former cia analyst in Mr Biden's transition team. Expressing her own views rather than the next administration's, she writes in a forthcoming paper for the East Asia Institute, a Seoul-based think-tank, that China sees chances to advance its goal of regional dominance in deadlocked American talks with North Korea. It sees similar potential gains from America's disputes with the South (Mr Trump told it to pay five times more towards the cost of American garrisons). China's assertiveness may "embolden, not rein in, Kim Jong Un", worries Ms Pak.
Pausing tests: useful but not the same as denuclearisation
Until June this year, Markus Garlauskas was America's national intelligence officer for North Korea. "We have reached a natural limit in terms of what we can get out of China on North Korea," says Mr Garlauskas, now with the Atlantic Council, a think-tank. Pressing North Korea to stop testing its most dangerous weapons is probably the most that China will do, he suggests by telephone from Washington. A moratorium on tests is not nothing: a new model of icbm is not credible until it has flown. But pausing tests alone is a thin basis for co-operation with China.
North Korea will provoke America's next president, triggering domestic headaches for Mr Biden as Republicans call him weak on China and North Korea, which they surely will (forgetting Mr Trump's talk of love letters from Mr Kim). That crisis will in turn test America's ties with China. The results will not be cheering.

全文文献: Headnote Tea before dawn
Visiting a century-old chaguan in China's heartland, for the 100th Chaguan column
DECADES SPENT brewing tea in rural Sichuan have left Li Qiang with firm views on what makes for an authentic chaguan, or Chinese teahouse. If age and beauty were the only tests, his shop, the Old Teahouse in Pengzhen, would pass easily. A place to drink tea for more than a century, the grey-roofed, timber-framed building dates back to the Ming dynasty, when it was a temple to Guanyin, a Buddhist immortal. Maoist slogans painted on the walls, in characters of faded red, reflect Pengzhen's history as a people's commune. Hours before dawn the air is already thick with tobacco smoke and fumes from a coal-fired stove, for the first customers arrive for "early tea" at half past three in the morning. Human companionship makes a teahouse, says Mr Li, who rented the hall from a collective enterprise in 1995. Only when customers treat a teashop like a home is it a chaguan, he declares. Until then, in Mr Li's withering judgment, it is merely "selling tea to passers-by".
Your correspondent visited Pengzhen this week to mark the 100th Chaguan column, a name that pays homage to China's teahouses and their history as places where ideas are exchanged. Mr Li's establishment draws a stream of locals. Many are old men in farmers' blue cotton jackets and caps, puffing on pungent cheroots or cigarettes in sturdy bamboo armchairs. Those photogenic customers lure Chinese urbanites, who carry expensive cameras and look for images of rural life or selfies to post on social media. Such a diverse customer base makes Mr Li's teahouse a good place for an experiment: an unscientific survey of how Chinese think. It being unsafe and unfair to ask Chinese citizens directly, in public, about Communist Party rule, this columnist spent a happy (if painfully early) few hours asking people two questions often used to assess morale in different countries. The first concerns a subject's own economic circumstances. The second is about whether future generations are likely to be better off than their parents.
The exercise generated strikingly consistent answers. Despite wide differences of age and education, patrons in the Old Teahouse are optimistic about China as a whole, after decades of rising prosperity. Yet many also describe modern life as stressful, with too many families chasing too few chances to secure a good education, a good job and other paths to success.
Jiang Huiyun, an 82-year-old widow, sits in a prime windowseat each morning from four o'clock. Crop-haired and chainsmoking, Ms Jiang married in 1957 at a time of scarcity and hunger. Her wedding feast consisted of carrot porridge, but only after she had pleaded tearfully with her production-brigade leader for an advance on her vegetable ration. None of her four children finished junior high school. Her eldest son dropped out in his first year of primary school after being unjustly accused of vandalism. He earned money by "collecting dog shit and chicken shit", remembers Ms Jiang. In the 1950s toughs attacked anyone with a side business as "capitalists", she recalls. During the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, Red Guards smashed Buddhist statues in Pengzhen's temple-teahouse and "nobody dared to stop them".
Unsurprisingly, she thinks life today is far better. As a rural pensioner she receives social insurance and old-age payments of over 2,000 yuan ($300) a month. Her grandchildren, having graduated from university, are upwardly mobile like many young people these days. A quarter-century ago just one-in-twenty Chinese attended university. Today half of all Chinese youngsters of undergraduate age are in higher education. Ms Jiang no longer lives in fear of hunger or political violence. Still, some forms of scarcity involve things that are harder to spot, such as equal access to opportunity. Like many in Pengzhen, Ms Jiang's family have rural household-registration, or hukou. As a result, her grandchildren are second-class citizens, able to live and work in big cities but denied many public services there. Notably, they will have to find fees of 30,000 yuan a year to send Ms Jiang's great-grandchildren to high school. "If we didn't borrow money from others, how could we afford that?" she asks. Ms Jiang is emphatic: "We have a good life now." But she adds: "Young people face a lot of pressures."
In China to get rich is glorious, but daily life is a slog
A middle-aged man sipping tea before work will give only his surname, Huang. He praises modern China, declaring that "Each generation is doing better than the last." Yet Mr Huang's own life remains precarious. Now 59, he has no retirement fund. So he saves 1,000 yuan from his monthly pay as a cleaner in a factory, which ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 yuan depending on overtime. He went unpaid while covid-19 closed his factory for nearly three months, and has not forgotten the terror of worrying if his savings would run out before work resumed. His hopes rest on enabling his fiveyear-old grandchild to land a good job one day, though he worries about school fees. Taking early tea is one of his few indulgences. His daughter is too busy working to visit teahouses, he sighs.
Two 20-year-old women photographing tea-drinkers turn out to be undergraduates from Sichuan University of Media and Communications, on a class assignment. "There is definitely a lot of pressure" on the young, says one. She has an internship but no job lined up after graduation. Her mother's uncomplicated childhood memories-"stealing bananas in the countryside"-make her almost envious. Still, the students are confident that life is better today, though not confident enough to give their names to a foreign reporter asking almost-political questions.
Mr Li, 55, suggests that some people create pressure for themselves by setting their sights too high. A devotee of the simple life, his menu consists of a single item: jasmine tea from Ya'an, in the foothills of the Tibetan plateau. He charges locals one yuan for unlimited refills, and everyone else ten yuan. "You chat a bit, drink some tea every day, that's happiness," he says. Pengzhen's uneventful pleasures are not for everyone, for modern China is a restless, brutally unequal place. The tea, however, is excellent.

全文文献: Headnote Nothing will change China's view: America is bent on blocking its rise
Shortly before election day in America, Chaguan spent an instructive morning in central Beijing listening to a senior Chinese official explain why his country does not care who sits in the White House. This was partly bravado, for China's rulers do not care to play up the idea that mere voters might hold world leaders to account. But the official's disdain also reflects an elite consensus that a full reset of us-China relations is difficult to imagine.
China wants smoother ties with America, said the official. But given their deep roots, present-day tensions will be hard to reverse unless America comes to a new understanding of the world. Westerners are a self-centred and judgmental lot, he charged. They never expected the Chinese-a diligent, studious people-to rival them so soon. No matter which party runs Washington, the official said, "The us has to answer this question: can the us or the Western world accept or respect the rise of China?"
To Chinese leaders, Donald Trump's aggression in office merely accelerated some inevitable trends. To them, the Trump era shows that talk of values is a sham, that China alarms Americans because it is getting stronger-and that the solution is to become more powerful, until Western critics are shamed into silence by China's success. They also think that American weakness is making that ex-hegemon (even more) vicious and determined to scapegoat China. Back when Xi Jinping was China's vice-president, he spent many hours with his counterpart Joe Biden, who is seen as an establishment centrist close to business sectors that want better China ties. But struggle with America is seen as unavoidable.
Ordinary Chinese citizens never followed an American election so closely. But many watched with more scorn than envy. Instead, abetted by censors who allowed mocking jokes and memes about the race to flood social media, a common view is that the result is irrelevant. The Chinese internet is full of posts backing Mr Trump. Most reflect glee over his pugnacious style and a hunch that his incompetence, notably in handling covid-19, has usefully harmed America. Other fans include nationalists grateful for Mr Trump's reluctance to condemn official abuses in places like Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as, confusingly, dissidents and Hong Kongers who think him tough on the Communist Party.
Americans may object that Chinese views of their politics are cartoonish, incoherent and self-serving. But cynicism about the democratic West-among both elites and the general public-matters. For it helps to explain how the party will approach what its Central Committee described on October 29th as a "profound adjustment in the international balance of power".
Elite cynicism about America preoccupies Chairman Rabbit, a Harvard-educated Chinese blogger whose 1.7m followers on Weibo, a social-media platform, include business leaders and officials in government ministries. Ren Yi, the chairman's real name, is a mainstream nationalist with princeling blood: his grandfather was a reformist party secretary of Guangdong province in the 1980s. His posts explore the nuances of American politics. But the wider public associates such nuance with naivety. Mr Trump was liked in China until 2018, says Mr Ren over coffee in a Beijing hotel. His populist nationalism resonated, as did his praise for President Xi. His slogan "Make America Great Again" mirrored talk of a great Chinese rejuvenation. Even the trade war had fans, at first. When Mr Trump's envoys pushed China to speed up market-opening reforms, some influential Chinese were sympathetic to American arguments, recalls Mr Ren. Three events changed the mood. Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a boss at Huawei, a Chinese tech giant, on behalf of American prosecutors investigating alleged sanctions-busting. Then American politicians cheered on anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Finally came America's bungling of the pandemic, even as the Chinese public complied with strict health controls that tamed the virus at home.
Mr Ren saw friends concluding that all American politicians are as bad as each other. Most Chinese "think of us politics as a huge conspiracy to keep China down", a suspicion that they flaunt as a badge of sophistication, says the blogger. Where once the Chinese romanticised America as an advanced nation, "Now because of covid they see the us people as selfish, anti-science, anti-intellectual." It is no accident that events that angered Chinese-Ms Meng's arrest and the protests in Hong Kong-touched on sovereignty. Homogeneous China finds it hard to comprehend pluralistic, divided America, says Mr Ren. What Chinese really care about is China's strength and territorial integrity. "They think that it is China's destiny to rise, and so to come into conflict with America."
Too late to contain China, still time to compete
Popular opinion concerns Wang Yong, who directs the Centre for American Studies at Peking University, one of China's most prestigious institutions. A frequent guest on state media, he made a series of short election-eve videos about America for Jinri Toutiao, an online platform, racking up over 10m visits. As he describes it, America's China policies are guided by competing interest groups, with Mr Biden heeding the Wall Street financiers and Silicon Valley bosses who seek "more rational" ties with China, while hawks and "deep-state forces" push for a new cold war. China and America can work together on such shared interests as climate change, public health and enabling global prosperity, he insists. Yet people should be realistic, says the professor over jasmine tea near his university. America "has been accustomed to the top position in world affairs and will use all means to defend its status".
Amid such distrust, any Chinese rapprochement with America should be understood for what it is: a bid to buy time while China races to become stronger. China's rulers are not hiding their worldview, which is based on the idea that only the powerful are treated with respect. America can choose whether or not to compete. But it has been warned: American gridlock would be a win for China. *

全文文献: Headnote To see why China may struggle to achieve high-tech self-reliance, visit an industrial chicken farm
It takes an effort-a small hardening of the heart-to see day-old Jinghai Poultry chicks for what they are. These, for all their plaintive cheeping and soft, fuzzy plumage, are tiny, high-performance meat factories. The product of decades of genetic research in American and European laboratories, they hatch in China thanks to global supply chains, involving the air-freighting of eggs and chicks between secure breeding sites on five continents.
Those chains are more fragile than once supposed. Animal diseases, the us-China trade war and covid-19 have all disrupted, or threatened to disrupt, industrial chicken supplies. That makes those chicks a window onto something interesting: China's increasingly complicated relationship with high-tech globalisation, a force that has made the country more prosperous, but also reliant on the outside world in ways that trouble Communist Party bosses.
The unsentimental logic of high-performance poultry-rearing is easy to grasp. Standing this week in the loading bay of a factory farm in the coastal province of Jiangsu, Chaguan heard Jinghai executives explain how "white-feather meat chickens", as they are known in China, grow to 2.5kg in 40 days. Homegrown varieties of "yellow-feather chicken", descended from backyard fowl, take twice as long to mature and will only ever weigh half as much. Clients collect cardboard trays holding 102 chicks, peeking through slats in the sides. Four trays can generate a tonne of chicken.
Nor is China's interest in cheap protein mysterious. Half a century ago meat was a rare luxury. Now, many see it as a daily necessity. In the meantime, the country's supplies of farmland and clean water have not grown. Agriculture remains blighted by food-safety scandals, the rampant use of fake or illegal animal medicines, and disease outbreaks. Small surprise, then, that Chinese leaders give frequent speeches about food security. A puzzle lurks, though. Leaders also call for self-reliance in key technologies. And in the case of broiler chickens, those two ambitions-rearing meat efficiently and avoiding dependence on imports-are in tension.
The chicks cheeping at Chaguan are the fifth-generation descendants of pedigree birds whose bloodlines represent 80 years of selection for such traits as efficient food-to-meat conversion, rapid growth, strong leg bones and disease resistance. After waves of consolidation, the industry is dominated by two firms, Aviagen (based in Alabama and owned by the ew Group of Germany) and Cobb (owned by Tyson, an American poultry giant).
The most valuable pedigree birds never leave maximum-security farms in America and Britain: a single pedigree hen may generate 4m direct descendants. Their second-generation offspring are flown to breeding sites dispersed between such places as Brazil, Britain and New Zealand, in part to hedge against supply shocks when avian influenzas and other diseases close borders. Day-old third-generation chicks are air-freighted to local partners such as Jinghai, which spend six months growing them and breeding them in climate-controlled, artificially lit indoor facilities. In all, China imports 1.6m third-generation white-feather chicks a year.
Jinghai hatches 8m fourth-generation, "parent stock" chickens annually. The company sells some to other agri-businesses. It breeds from the rest to produce fifth-generation chicks like those cheeping at Chaguan. These are "meat chickens", consumed in fast-food outlets, schools and factory canteens, or as chicken parts sold in supermarkets. Yellow-feather chickens, deemed tastier by Chinese cooks, account for most whole birds sold in markets.
Chinese breeders have long tried to create local varieties with bloodlines available in-country. Breeding from imported third- or fourth-generation chickens is a bad solution: their genes are less desirable than those of their elite grandparents, making them a poor starting-point for a new variety. In September the State Council, China's cabinet, issued a paper on livestock-rearing that set self-sufficiency in poultry as a goal, calling meat-chicken breeding a priority. Big foreign firms have resisted appeals from officials to send second-generation stock to China. A poultry firm with 10% of the domestic market, Fujian Sunner, says it has bred all-Chinese broilers: their performance is a source of some debate.
Dependence on foreign bloodlines does carry risks. For several months recently New Zealand was one of the only countries able to send third-generation chicks to China, after other exporters suffered bird-flu outbreaks. Li Jinghui, president of the China Broiler Alliance, an industry association, calls conditions ripe for China's "brilliant" scientists to develop local birds. Mr Li adds that Chinese diners do not share the West's love of breast meat and think chicken feet a delicacy, so that Chinese-bred broilers might have bigger thighs and feet. But Mr Li suggests that the government's aim is diversifying meat supplies, rather than literal self-sufficiency. Let Chinese and foreign chicken breeds compete like Huawei and Apple smartphones, he urges: market forces should decide the result.
Don't even ask about animal rights
Wang Hongsheng, a boss at Jinghai, admits to fretting about interruptions to chick supplies, even wondering if President Donald Trump might curb American exports. But to develop a domestic breed from scratch would take years, and if it does not meet market needs, a firm could spend a fortune "without much to show for it".
High-tech chickens are not as sleek as high-speed trains or as clever as quantum computers. Still, they are a case study of why self-reliance is hard. China's poultry market has room to grow: Westerners each eat far more chicken than Chinese do. But without a stronger animal-health system and environmental controls, biotechnology alone cannot help China to develop world-class agriculture. Moreover, a long-standing Chinese strategy-bullying foreign firms to hand over intellectual property-is counter-productive now. Western trust in China is low, and official talk of selfsufficiency is one cause. The politics of globalisation get tricky when one side feels it is being readied for the pot. *

全文文献: Headnote The contradictions of a half-loving, half-threatening pitch to Taiwan
China's communist party is not known for bumper stickers- those slogans that fit a political philosophy into a six-inch space next to a car's brake lights. (Chaguan once covered an election in Kentucky in which the Republican candidate's bumper sticker read, in its entirety: "Coal. Guns. Freedom.") Party slogans need not trip off the tongue to be printed on red banners and displayed on streets, as in: "Hold high the great banner of Xi Jinping Thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era."
A tolerance for complexity comes in handy when trying to comprehend the approach of Chinese leaders to Taiwan, a democratic island which China deems a province that must unite with the mainland. For their pitch is a mess of contradictions. On the one hand China's rulers talk of deep ties of blood and kinship with Taiwan's 24m people, even as the proportion of islanders who define themselves as Chinese falls each year. This campaign does not just involve wooing Taiwanese business bosses with access to mainland markets. Despite covid-induced travel headaches, a small legion of Chinese officials remain employed in a hearts-and-minds industry, planning summer camps, study tours and other peopleto-people exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
On the other hand, China's honeyed words for Taiwan are becoming hard to hear over the pounding of war drums. Each night for a whole week recently, state television carried taped confessions from alleged Taiwanese spies caught in a nationwide campaign. The People's Daily, the party's mouthpiece, carried a commentary on the spy probe written by the state security ministry. It restated China's resolve to use force if needs be, using a phrase- "Don't say we didn't warn you"-that has preceded Chinese military action against other countries in the past. In recent months China has sent its warplanes more often than usual on sorties near Taiwan, notably during visits to the island by Trump administration officials. It has also stepped up the tempo of its military exercises. The Global Times, a strident tabloid, noted "rumours" about the recent deployment of advanced hypersonic missiles to coastal bases, and helpfully explained that they are ideal for scaring American and allied warships away from intervening in any war with Taiwan. Not to be outdone, on October 8th Chinese diplomats posted to the Pacific island of Fiji were involved in a brawl at a party celebrating Taiwan's national day, staged at a local hotel by Taiwanese officials. Though the skirmish sent a Taiwanese envoy to hospital with head injuries, a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing blamed the event's Taiwanese hosts for the violence, and for provocatively displaying their island's "self-styled flag" on a cake.
This uptick in bellicose rhetoric reflects Chinese anger at growing support for Taiwan in Washington and a desire to teach the island's government and people that relying on America for protection will lead to their doom. Communist Party bosses will only engage with Taiwanese who agree that their island is part of a country called China. That rule allows them to talk to the Nationalist Party, heirs to the regime that ran the Republic of China until 1949, lost a civil war to Communist forces and retreated to exile in Taiwan. It excludes the island's president, Tsai Ing-wen, and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Ms Tsai, a cautious, catloving moderate depicted as a dangerous radical in China, says that the island she governs is a country in its own right, though to avoid a crisis she fudges what is meant by that. Chinese threats are typically accompanied by a line or two about the prosperous future that awaits Taiwan if it accepts the motherland's embrace. Distilled to sticker-length, the double-edged message to Taiwan amounts to: "Come home, or China will kill you."
The hearts-and-minds industry is ready to invest in Taiwanese who are receptive to talk of shared blood ties. Just 360,000 people live in Jimei, a district of Xiamen, the coastal city nearest to Taiwan. In Chinese terms, it is a speck on the map. But the district government spent 50m yuan ($7.5m) on a hotel-sized "cross-strait exchange base". It opened in 2019 to offer subsidised study camps to Taiwanese youngsters, who are mixed with mainland students to enhance the experience. Up to 500 students can be housed in its smart dormitories. Young visitors are greeted by a portrait of President Xi and his words declaring the two sides of the strait to be "one family, their hearts connected from a young age". They are encouraged to explore such totems of shared culture as a puppet theatre, an opera house, a dragon boat and a giant floor map of China (Taiwan included). They can build moon rovers in a classroom dedicated to China's space programme, construct model sailingjunks and pilot a drone. Some 140,000 students visited last year, 5,000 of them Taiwanese. In this pandemic year the centre hosted over 1,000 Taiwanese whose families live on the mainland. Jimei is building a second study base with room for 2,400 students, which is due to open next year. A wall plaque immortalises a tribute paid by a Taiwanese student who called Xiamen "much grander" than his island's capital, Taipei. "It's scary, how fast they are advancing," he is quoted as saying.
China's public wants Taiwan to hurry up and surrender
Young Taiwanese are far warier of China than their elders are. So China's soft-power sector also caters to retired Taiwanese military officers and ageing members of clan associations seeking mainland roots. The Guandi temple in Dongshan, south of Xiamen, is a "mother temple" to religious sites on Taiwan and a favoured spot for cross-strait events. This week a straw poll of Chinese tourists at the temple found several who think there may be a war with Taiwan. Yet when asked whom they blame for tensions, few seemed curious about hearts and minds on the island. They described Taiwanese as Chinese and China's armies as crushingly superior. "It's not about who's in the wrong, just who's stronger," said a woman who declined to give her name. If China allowed political bumper stickers, the cynical nationalism of her words would be a hit. *

全文文献: Headnote China calls its handling of the pandemic a "heroic feat" proving the Communist Party's wisdom
Aseries of failures made 2020 a rough year for China's relations with the world. First, Chinese officials-following the logic of their unaccountable, secretive one-party system-failed to report an unknown virus in the central city of Wuhan for several critical weeks, giving covid-19 time to take hold. More failures followed. As one foreign government after another botched its own response, China's rulers refused to take any blame for the pandemic, instead slapping economic sanctions on such countries as Australia that called for inquiries into the outbreak's origins. The costs are plain to see: a recent survey of rich countries by the Pew Research Centre found soaring distrust of China (with negative views in Australia jumping 24 percentage points since last year).
That political gulf between China and the world is set to widen. This time, the cause will be asymmetric success. China has effectively controlled covid-19 and its economy is returning to life. Meanwhile, governments in America, Europe and beyond face second waves of infections and business bankruptcies and exploding public deficits. Several elected incumbents will lose office.
Amid that global misery, China's leaders call their country's recovery proof that Communist Party rule offers a uniquely effective blend of organisational prowess, respect for science, and traditional Chinese morality. They are about to discover how provocative that boasting will sound to many in the rest of the world. Foreign anger will in turn prompt resentment within China. Ordinary Chinese remember the collective sacrifices made by hundreds of millions of citizens who stopped transmission by staying indoors for weeks, often without pay. Glib lines from Western politicians about admiring China's people and opposing the Communist Party will not help. People are complicated. It is possible for Chinese citizens to remember their leaders' early mistakes, to resent officials for thuggishly enforcing lockdowns, and at the same time to agree that the country's pandemic response is a source of national pride. Modern China's story is not one of oppressed masses all yearning to be free. Party bosses stake their claim to rule on making people's lives better. Their China is a majoritarian project that enjoys broad, if unknowable, public support. The headache for foreign governments is how to respond when the party crushes minorities that get in the way, whether ethnic, religious or political.
Covid-19 has given a fresh edge to arguments about which political system is best. It is hard to overstate how bad the West's handling of the virus looks to ordinary Chinese. It is heartbreaking to hear Western-educated liberals wonder whether democracy is being exposed as selfish and disorderly. Longtime admirers of America watch President Donald Trump blaming their country for unleashing a "China virus" on the world, and hear a horrifying incitement to racial hatred. Chinese nationalists feel vindicated.
Diplomats in Beijing compare covid-19 to the global financial crisis of 2008, another event that convinced many Chinese leaders that the West is in long-term decline. Arguably, this pandemic is a more perilous moment. For one thing, in 2008 the credit crunch was a crisis discussed between Chinese and Western elites. Few American or European voters either knew or cared that global growth was being sustained by massive Chinese investments in domestic infrastructure. For another, China was not on the defensive. Elites in Beijing were tut-tutting observers of a crisis created in the West. As one Chinese leader told Americans in 2008: "You were our teacher, and the teacher doesn't look very smart."
This time, on both sides, elites and regular folk have strong views about covid-19. In Beijing, Western diplomats recall this pandemic year with real bitterness. They remember the dark days of January and February as their home governments cancelled scheduled flights to and from China, and pleaded for permission to evacuate citizens from Wuhan, only to be summoned for hourslong meetings at the Chinese foreign ministry, where officials angrily accused them of sowing panic and insulting China. With unblushing hypocrisy, China then turned round and sealed its borders still more tightly a few weeks later, after foreign infection rates climbed. Early on, foreign countries were asked to send medical aid to China without any publicity, and complied. Later, when they sought to buy Chinese ventilators for their own patients, they were told that the price included public praise for China.
Why China's return to growth will inspire mixed feelings
Far from the embassies in Beijing, foreign views of China have soured dramatically, too. In the Pew survey of public opinion in advanced economies, a median of 61% of respondents deplored China's handling of covid-19. Chinese officials blame such criticism on scapegoating by anti-China hawks in America. That is self-serving tosh. Thirteen of the 14 countries polled were even harsher about America's covid blunders. The survey is a record of public displeasure over mistakes made, not a festival of China-bashing.
Foreign scepticism about China's record is not entirely fair. Some in the West speculate that China is hiding mass infections. That is improbable: despite strict censorship, news of another Wuhan-like catastrophe would leak. Instead, after early cover-ups, China's response has been simple but effective. Since late March it has closed its borders to most foreigners, built high-tech systems to monitor domestic travel and attacked even small flare-ups with lockdowns and mass testing. After announcing a dozen cases on October 11th, the coastal city of Qingdao began testing 9m people.
Yet a core claim made by the party is also false-that its crushing of covid-19 proves the unique advantages of autocracy. Off China's coast, the democratic island of Taiwan has handled the virus brilliantly, recording just seven deaths in a population of 23m.
The arguments will not stop even if vaccines are found to beat the virus back. Shared suffering did not bring the world together in 2020. Alas, a lopsided global recovery, especially if accompanied by Chinese bragging, risks creating still sharper divisions. *

全文文献: Headnote China draws stark lessons from the 70th anniversary of its entry into the Korean war
An optimist might call it progress that China's national memorial to the Korean war, newly reopened after years of renovations, has reduced the space devoted to a Mao-era hoax-the charge that America used the plague and cholera as bio-weapons during that conflict, thereby committing a war crime.
It is dismaying that the allegations remain on display at all in the memorial, a hilltop complex overlooking the Chinese border city of Dandong and, across the Yalu river, the North Korean town of Sinuiju. The memorial reopened in late September, ahead of the 70th anniversary of China's entry into the conflict that laid waste to the Korean peninsula from 1950 to 1953, and that Chinese leaders call "The War to Resist America and Aid Korea". Still, hopeful sorts might note that the hoax was once a much bigger deal. The allegations of germ warfare were worldwide news in the first months of 1952. Chinese and North Korean leaders saw a chance to challenge the legitimacy of the American superpower. In Europe, Soviet-bloc governments and Western sympathisers staged protest marches involving millions of people, accusing American warplanes of dropping bombs packed with bacteria-laced insects on Korea and northern China.
The new memorial in Dandong charges America with crimes against international law in a single display panel, offering few details. A glass case offers supposed evidence: an old bomb casing, and dusty test-tubes containing "bacteria-carrying insects scattered by the us forces". In reality the tale was long ago debunked, notably by documents that emerged from Soviet archives decades after the war. The papers included a resolution by the Soviet government in 1953 that called reports of American germ warfare in Korea "fictitious". A study by Milton Leitenberg for the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington cites memoirs by Wu Zhili, a former head of China's military medical service in Korea. Wu called talk of germ warfare a "false alarm" that did not make sense: some alleged drop-zones were just metres from American lines, and the winter weather was far too cold for bacteriological warfare.
Cheerful souls might conclude that modern China's rulers are embarrassed by this old propaganda but cannot easily disown it, so are taking a middle path. Chaguan draws a different lesson from a recent visit to the memorial. The new museum may tone down its anti-Americanism, eschewing the previous memorial's statements about American imperialism being exposed as a "paper tiger". But in its place is something that may prove just as disruptive: a deep disdain for the West, which is portrayed as unable to match the efficiency and order of Communist Party rule. Indeed, America's germ-warfare campaign is called a military failure, thanks to clever Chinese and North Korean anti-epidemic work.
The museum has reflected political trends since it first opened in 1958. Back then, its displays followed North Korea's line that the war began with a surprise attack by South Korea-a reversal of the historical truth. Today, in 2020, the museum in Dandong says coyly that "On June 25th 1950 the Korean civil war broke out," without assigning blame. The memorial closed in 1966 when the commander of Chinese forces in Korea, Peng Dehuai, purged for questioning Mao and later rehabilitated, came under renewed attack. It did not reopen until 1993, a year after China normalised relations with South Korea-a rapprochement that enraged the North and made it urgent for China to assert its version of history. The hall closed again in 2014, ostensibly for repairs, amid Chinese anger at missile tests and nuclear-weapons research by North Korea.
The latest memorial has an intensely domestic focus. Its dioramas, enlivened with the bright lights of projected explosions and the boom of recorded gunfire, feature American soldiers in two roles: fleeing and dying. North Koreans are glimpsed mostly as helpless civilians, thanking Chinese troops for rescuing them.
Chinese students are taught that their country entered the war in self-defence against American invasion threats, sending "Chinese people's volunteers" in canvas shoes and thin cotton uniforms against swaggering Americans armed with tanks and warplanes. Textbooks describe these Chinese troops hurling rocks when ammunition ran out, teaching the world to respect the young People's Republic of China. In reality, the war was a bloodbath that ended where it started, with Korea divided along the 38th parallel, at a cost of perhaps 400,000 Chinese lives (the memorial admits to less than half that number). In this 70th anniversary year, those events have been distilled into a simple moral about not fearing America's strength. State media stress how weak and poor China was in 1950. They praise Communist pioneers for daring to attack America, and for realising that, faced with such a bully, they had to seek "peace through fighting".
The party's worldview: endless struggle
Chaguan did not hear nostalgia for war among the museum's visitors. He did find admiration for the willingness of previous generations to accept hardship. A local man, Xiu Dexiang, had brought a five-year-old son dressed in a miniature army uniform. "I want to let him know that this life we have did not come easily, and he needs to cherish it," he explained.
Li Quanxin, a 90-year-old Red Army veteran, drew lessons from the memorial about Chinese self-discipline. "Take this pandemic. Two hundred thousand people died in America! What's their leader doing? Look at how calm China is now," he growled. "China's decision-making is really something. From the Korean war to covid, the path we choose is sure, and the world is in awe."
Later in October China will award medals to surviving veterans of Korea. Big-budget films about the conflict are heading to cinemas and television screens. Talk of resisting America can hardly be avoided: it is in China's name for the war. Elaborate challenges to America's legitimacy will not be needed. To China's rulers, their system's superiority and the West's decline are self-evident. *

摘要: In such a China it is no longer a question of dry trade law whether Western businesses should seek "national treatment", meaning the same market access conditions as Chinese ones.

全文文献: Headnote Reciprocity is a buzzword in diplomacy between China and the West. It is not a cure-all
Rarely in the history of China's contacts with the West have so many powerful people, in so many capitals, agreed that relations must be guided by the principle of fairness. When President Xi Jinping and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, give speeches that touch on Sino-American ties, the calls for mutual respect, shared benefits and avoiding double standards come thick and fast. The Europeans sound just as keen on fair play. In recent years the leaders of France, Germany and European Union institutions have led smaller powers in a sustained chorus, telling China that Europe is open for business, as long as it is on a basis of reciprocity. To quote France's president, Emmanuel Macron, speaking in 2018 in the old caravan stop of Xi'an, the "new silk roads" proposed by China cannot run in only one direction.
A striking number of the ideas that fill officials' speeches and the communiques of summits come from the world of trade law. There is much talk of level playing-fields and non-discrimination. Yet a puzzle lurks. This focus on fairness is not making either side any happier. In the grim assessment of a veteran diplomat in Beijing, the last time that relations between China and the West were this bad was 1990, just a year after the crushing of democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
In the face of this puzzle, Chaguan has two solutions to suggest. The first is that trade law is a flawed template for designing China policies. Trade lawyers are good at disputes between countries about mismatched import tariffs or airline landing rights. They are of less use in solving questions of high politics.
Earlier this month Mr Xi called on the Communist Party to strengthen its oversight over private companies. New party guidelines call for the creation of a vanguard of "private businesspeople who are reliable and useful at critical moments". In such a China it is no longer a question of dry trade law whether Western businesses should seek "national treatment", meaning the same market access conditions as Chinese ones. Should foreign firms want to be treated like Chinese ones, if that means giving party committees a management role and sharing sensitive data with the state?
These are not easy questions. At least rhetorically, Trump aides increasingly sound as if they have made up their minds. The attorney-general, William Barr, recently declared: "The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States." Contemplating reported espionage against American universities and businesses, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, accused the Communist Party of exploiting America's "free and open society". Follow that logic, and decoupling would make America safer than remaining open to Mr Xi's China.
European governments disagree strongly. If America's next president is Joe Biden, he will reject decoupling, too. Still, something durable has shifted in Western views of China. For most of the past 40 years, rich-world democratic governments believed that openness to China benefited them disproportionately. It is extraordinary to read a report from 2004 about reciprocity in military-to-military ties, produced by the rand Corporation for the United States Air Force. This noted that American officers visiting China were always taken to the same showcase bases (often near the Great Wall or other tourist sites), while Chinese military delegations to America were allowed access to lots of sensitive units. Do not worry, several defence officials told rand's researchers: America enjoys such a "surplus of strength" that showing off to Chinese visitors is a form of deterrence.
Breezy arguments of this kind are not heard today. China is too well-armed for that. It is also far more assertive. "Wolf warrior" Chinese diplomats have threatened Western governments that they will suffer if they refuse to buy 5G kit from Chinese firms like Huawei. Rather than attack the United States head-on, China has mounted trade and diplomatic boycotts against American allies that it sees as doing America's bidding. Targets have ranged from South Korea to Canada and Australia.
Alas, reciprocity is no cure-all, as the Trump administration is proving. All year, China and America have expelled each other's journalists by the score. Mr Trump's officials picked this fight after seeing an analogy with unfair trade practices, says an insider. There were many more Chinese journalists in America than vice versa, and it was easier for them to get visas. Since polite appeals to balance out visa numbers had not worked, those officials decided there was little to lose from getting tough. Team Trump was wrong, and major American news bureaus in China have been gutted by expulsions of their reporters. Demanding reciprocity can be a good way to highlight gross asymmetries. It loses its leverage when others have different priorities and interests. China has many ways to learn about America without sending its own state-controlled media there. Its rulers also have lots to gain by expelling reporters from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and other outlets with unrivalled records of investigative journalism in China.
How dare you say I'm threatening?
That American misjudgment points to the second way in which a quest for reciprocity, by itself, cannot fix relations with China. America could never win a race to the bottom on press freedoms with China, without betraying liberal values that presidents before Mr Trump, at least, have held dear. Without liberal values behind it, reciprocity means not much more than getting even. After all, "an eye for an eye" is a fair, if bleak, code of conduct. China struggles to see this distinction. Alarmed and enraged to realise how it is distrusted by Western countries, its diplomats and state media are lashing out and threatening retaliation on multiple fronts-or "legitimate countermeasures", as China likes to put it. That version of reciprocity amounts to telling the world: "Stay open to China, or China will hurt you." As long as that is China's tone with the West, warm words about fairness will not solve much. *

摘要: State media never tire of showing Mr Xi touring rural areas to inspect the latest cash-generating crops and industries, like an austere but benevolent monarch. Lin Shucheng, Liangshan's party chief, is proud of outdoor "night schools" that teach farmers modern agricultural techniques, and village women embroidery and other handicrafts. For all that, poverty alleviation is not an act of disinterested charity.

全文文献: Headnote A propaganda tour reveals the ideological side of a giant poverty-alleviation campaign
STRIVING TO OBEY an order from President Xi Jinping-namely, that extreme poverty must be eliminated in China by the end of 2020-officials have given many things to Jizi Arimo, a 47-year-old widow and mother of four. Chaguan met Ms Jizi last week in a newly built apartment block in Yuexi, a once-remote rural county in the south-western province of Sichuan.
One way to tell Ms Jizi's story is with economic statistics. In her old home, high in the mountains, she was officially deemed impoverished. The poverty line varies a bit by region, but is set at around 2,300 yuan ($340) a year. As this year began, roughly 5m Chinese still needed to cross that line for Mr Xi's promise to be kept. Officials in Sichuan paid the lion's share of the costs of Ms Jizi's relocation, and now employ her as a cleaner at her housing complex, paying her 550 yuan a month.
Yet poverty alleviation is about more than numbers. Like much else in Mr Xi's China, it is also a strikingly political endeavour. Ms Jizi's home was one stop on a recent government tour of povertyrelated work, organised for foreign and domestic journalists. This was not a trip for verifying government claims independently, or for probing reports that some rural folk have been kept off poverty registers by bureaucrats anxious to hit targets. Officials stood over Ms Jizi as she answered questions. Throughout the visit, minders followed journalists who tried to break from the pack.
A frail figure in a checked overcoat and hat, Ms Jizi spoke perched on a sofa, beneath a colour poster of Mr Xi with the caption: "Be grateful to the party. Listen to the party. Follow the party". A member of the Yi minority, she is hesitant in Mandarin Chinese. To approving nods from officials, she declared: "If it weren't for General Secretary Xi, I wouldn't have such a lovely home." Every flat visited by the press was decorated with the same photograph of Mr Xi. A second poster on display in each apartment featured photographs of residents' old and new homes, and slogans like "Relocation warms our hearts and we are forever grateful to the party" and "Welcoming a new life with a smiling face". The whole housing estate is hung with party slogans and banners. Home to 6,660 relocated villagers, its name is "Gratitude Community".
Ms Jizi's new home is not exceptional. Other model communities visited on the tour were also plastered with posters praising the party and Mr Xi. The party secretary of Sichuan province, Peng Qinghua, told reporters that encouraging thankfulness was part of poverty-alleviation work. "Conservative and outdated thinking is the root cause of poverty," he explained. In his telling, the party's focus on moral education is a unique advantage of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In particular, he charged that the Yi, of whom about 2.5m live in Sichuan, needed to be led away from such "undesirable habits" as paying lavish dowries for brides, or holding extravagant funerals despite "not caring for their elderly parents while they are still alive". Mr Peng praised party members who lead by example. He paid tribute to officials killed in mountain carcrashes, and told of a party secretary who, rather than quit a rural posting and return to her home city to look after a newly widowed mother, brought her mother to live in the country.
That vision of party members as self-sacrificing, secular missionaries, leading the masses towards more productive lives, comes from the top. State media never tire of showing Mr Xi touring rural areas to inspect the latest cash-generating crops and industries, like an austere but benevolent monarch. Almost four decades ago the countryside was freed from misery by the abolition of collective farms, as Deng Xiaoping, the then paramount leader, allowed peasants to choose which crops to grow and to start their own businesses. In the Xi era officials seem confident, once more, that the government knows best. Technocrats interviewed in Liangshan prefecture, where Ms Jizi lives, deny that they are returning to central planning. They describe a hybrid model harnessing both state resources and market discipline. In many places, villagers are encouraged to rent their small plots of land to agricultural co-operatives, creating larger, more efficient farms which may then employ some of them as herdsmen or to pick crops. Government bodies and state-owned enterprises in the prosperous east are urged to buy Liangshan-grown apples, walnuts or buckwheat tea, as a patriotic duty.
In part, poverty alleviation is an urbanisation scheme. In the past two years alone, nearly 10m Chinese have been physically relocated from rural homes deemed "inhospitable". Officials say that all choose to move, with only a few older folk struggling to adjust. Some families move to cement-walled houses a short walk from their former homes of wood and mud. Others leave for apartments many miles away. Lots of youngsters head farther afield to work as migrants. The Yi are strong and unafraid of heights, enthuses an official. That makes them sought-after workers when electricity lines need stringing between pylons.
Coming down from the mountains
Young children learn Mandarin as well as the Yi language in the kindergartens now found in each village, readying them for the workforce. In Liangshan the government is building new boarding schools, some with subsidised books and accommodation. Lin Shucheng, Liangshan's party chief, is proud of outdoor "night schools" that teach farmers modern agricultural techniques, and village women embroidery and other handicrafts. If the poor are not educated and given incentives to work, he says, they will "sit in the sunshine in a corner, waiting for a government cheque".
The past should not be romanticised. Not long ago, farmers in Liangshan lived harsh, isolated lives. For all that, poverty alleviation is not an act of disinterested charity. China's poorest are being integrated into the national economy and trained to thank the party for it. Putting money in people's pockets is one measure of success. The greater prize is putting ideas in people's heads.

全文文献: Headnote Foreigners are wrong to hail China's one-party system as a way to save the planet
IT IS TIME that civic-minded Chinese become better acquainted with rubbish, suggests Chen Yu, a retired publisher from Shanghai, at the end of a Saturday spent counting litter on the banks of the Yangzi river. This afternoon's survey has a scientific purpose. Undaunted by the muggy heat and mosquitoes of late summer, Mrs Chen and three dozen other volunteers sort river debris on a concrete breakwater, before weighing and recording each pile on a smartphone app. The heap of takeaway food packaging is dismayingly large, and there are a surprising number of shoes.
The data are being collected by a Chinese environmental group, Rendu Ocean, which runs 90 coastal monitoring sites with the help of about 1,000 volunteers. Mrs Chen, who also has an unpaid post helping neighbours navigate Shanghai's strict new rubbishrecycling rules, is not surprised that the beach cleaners are mostly young and female. Older men can be conservative and easily embarrassed, she says, and this sort of volunteering is still rather new in China. Now 74, she is glad that youngsters are joining the cause: "It's good for the country, as well as the environment.
That patriotic note is echoed by Liu Yonglong, Rendu Ocean's founder. He emphasises that his non-profit organisation's work on the environment is complementary to that of the state. The enthusiasm of volunteers is "our comparative advantage to the government, he says. "The disadvantage is that of course we are not as professional. That is where the government can come in.
The official connections of Chinese ngos often make foreign campaign groups wary, report the authors of "China Goes Green, a new book that analyses the country's stated ambitions to build an "ecological civilisation and then share that model with the world. One of the co-authors, Judith Shapiro of American University in Washington, dc, records a discreet approach from a Dutch foundation that wanted to give an award to Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a well-known Chinese ngo, but wondered whether he was "sufficiently independent of the government. Wrong question, replied Ms Shapiro, urging the fretful Dutch to understand the scrutiny applied to Chinese civilsociety groups, including "chats over tea with security officials. Mr Ma has enlarged the boundaries of what is allowed, she argued. His group has empowered citizens to report polluters, helping allies within government to enforce environmental rules.
Successful green policies in China share common elements, the book argues. They eschew rigid targets and top-down solutions that "cut everything with the same knife, to borrow the Chinese phrase for one-size-fits-all prescriptions. Success stories also typically involve the state working with volunteer groups and seeking input from civil society. The book cites a reforestation scheme in the late 1990s in the Loess Plateau of north-western China. Designers spent two years consulting local farmers and scientists, tailoring their plans to local conditions. Orchards of walnuts and dates, shielded by desert willows and traditional landscaping techniques, slowly returned life to barren lands. Later, when impatient officials tried to scale up the scheme with the mass-planting of a few types of fast-growing, water-hungry tree, they failed.
As well as showing the limits of central planning, the book argues that China's rulers use greenery to cloak their long-standing authoritarian ambitions. Nomads in Inner Mongolia or Tibet were once stripped of their herds and forcibly moved to drab housing blocks in the name of modernity. Now they are subjected to "ecological migration, ostensibly to save grasslands from their grazing animals. Vast hydroelectric dams are still built over the objections of locals and environmentalists, but now in the name of fighting climate change. Abroad, China stresses the green credentials of its global infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road Initiative. It delivers cheap technologies to developing countries. But its leaders' green conscience is selective. In pursuit of national interests they send fishing fleets to pillage far-off seas. They sign opaque contracts with foreign governments to build coal-fired power stations, polluting mines and habitat-wrecking dams. They often rely on authoritarian allies to quell local protests.
Eco-authoritarianism as a means or an end?
In such cases, domestic and global environmental harms can be attributed directly to ruthless, top-down Chinese governance, suggests "China Goes Green. That matters because a growing number of foreign observers ask whether China's model of decisive, technocratic one-party rule might be Earth's last, best hope, at a time when liberal democracies seem unable to act. Essays and books have appeared with titles like "Will China Save the Planet? and "The Coming of Environmental Authoritarianism. Such works typically praise Chinese promises to fight climate change, and its hefty investments in wind farms or electric vehicles. But then, too often, some foreign admirers turn to wondering-with varying degrees of regret-whether the coercive powers of a dictatorship may be the only way to curb unsustainable ecological behaviours.
Examine the record, and in reality Chinese authoritarianism more often undercuts green goals. At moments, it is hard to tell whether the driving force behind a green policy is a desire for a cleaner environment, or an obsession with social controls. Take Shanghai's recycling rules, which came into force in July 2019. Though the regulations address a real problem, they are fiddly and onerous and reek of distrust for residents. Li Yifei of New York University in Shanghai, the other author of "China Goes Green, reports conversations with rubbish inspectors in that city, discussing their powers to rummage inside residents' refuse sacks and to punish those who dump garbage outside approved hours. Soon, several inspectors boasted, bins will have facial-recognition cameras to catch violators, bringing an "orderly future a step closer. Yet a truly sustainable future needs more than order and rules: it relies on citizens' free choices. Coercion cannot save the planet.

全文文献: Headnote What a lowly, unpopular law-enforcement agency reveals about Chinas version of dictatorship
For a business that flouts the law in a police state, Mrs Hu's pancake cart is not hard to find. A tiny, unlicensed kitchen on wheels, her pushcart appears each night between 11pm and dawn on a road junction in central Beijing, between a centuries-old temple and a bus station. Neither summer heat nor snow deters Mrs Hu. Only rain keeps her at home, because it clears the streets of customers. On a recent night, diners munching her egg and onion pancakes, perched outdoors on low plastic stools, ranged from young hipsters to a bus driver still in her uniform.
It is not the romance of the night that inspires Mrs Hu's hours. Working by day would increase the risks of trouble from the chengguan-poorly paid, widely disliked city-management officers who enforce local regulations in urban areas. In Beijing the rules are ever-less tolerant of street food, deemed unhygienic and unworthy of a capital city. There has been one positive change: less than five years ago chengguan were often violent, grabbing stallholders' goods and demanding money. Now chengguan shoo vendors away but do not hit them. Mrs Hu ascribes their improved manners to a government campaign for "civilised law-enforcement".
A migrant from central China, she remains an outsider with few rights although she has lived in Beijing for 24 years. She and her husband once worked legally from a rented market stall. Then two markets in a row were demolished in the name of modernity, forcing the couple onto night-time streets with separate pancake carts. Worldly wise, the pair stayed calm when the prime minister, Li Keqiang, suggested this summer that encouraging street traders might boost a covid-battered economy. Food carts may be welcomed by smaller cities but not in Beijing, says Mrs Hu. Indeed, the capital is currently closing markets and sweeping away vegetablesellers from its streets. So she and her husband survive by keeping their heads down and working hard. Like many, they live on the margins of society, navigating an authoritarian system that wields its powers more selectively than outsiders may suppose.
There is nothing kindly about that security machine, which crushes all hints of political, religious or ethnic dissent or open challenges to the Communist Party. The machine is bent on abolishing privacy, with surveillance cameras on every corner and censors and algorithms scouring the online world for forbidden ideas. Yet when public-security agencies encounter non-political rulebreakers or even protesters, they can be unexpectedly willing to turn a blind eye or make concessions to offenders.
Such haggling is common at the lowest levels of law-enforcement, where the chengguan work. As luck would have it, a remarkable documentary about these para-police has just secured a limited release in Chinese cinemas. "City Dream", directed by Chen Weijun, follows chengguan from the central (and, since then, virus-hit) city of Wuhan, as they match wits with Wang Tiancheng, a 70-year-old street trader with a genius for staging the sorts of noisy protests that win the sympathy of a watching crowd, while humiliating officers sent to demolish his sprawling, unlawful street stall.
Cities created chengguan in the late 1990s to tackle non-criminal forms of disorder, after the dismantling of the planned economy left urbanites less dependent on the state and triggered a wave of rural migration into cities. The documentary begins in 2014, shortly after Wuhan announced a revolution in city management as part of a development drive. At the time chengguan had a grim reputation across China, following a number of deaths caused by officers as well as fatal attacks on them as they were carrying out raids to demolish homes or clear informal markets.
High-ups in the city-management bureau loathe "Old Wang", as everyone calls him. "Close the gates! Old Wang is on his way!" they yelp, as the former farmer heads to the chengguan offices, barrelchested, shirtless and demanding to see the boss. Sure that he makes more money than he lets on, officials send patrolmen to spy on his fruit sales (an undercover officer returns in tears, after Old Wang grabs his notebook). A senior chengguan declares that the street trader, who moved to Wuhan 14 years earlier from the central province of Henan, should be renting a clean, respectable shop. "That's the real life of a city dweller," the officer sniffs. In contrast, street-level chengguan are grudgingly impressed by Old Wang's flair for drama. During several raids on his stall, the trader tells gawking onlookers about his disabled son and cancer-stricken wife. He slaps a chengguan, tears up legal notices, accuses officers of taking bribes to leave his competitors alone, threatens to commit suicide and-in an astonishing moment-appeals to his tormentors as fellow outcasts at the bottom of society. "Where is your conscience?" Old Wang asks chengguan who have penned him within a square formed of their riot shields. "A second ago you were just like me. A man with no job." None can meet his gaze.
The power of the powerless
At one point Old Wang's son compares his father to a hen, frantically trying to protect chicks from an eagle. It is a revealing image. In the end Old Wang loses, for he is thrashing around in the grip of a much stronger beast. But he gains a concession, too: the city's help to stay and work in Wuhan for three more years, until his granddaughter, a good student, finishes secondary school. The price is apologising in writing for his earlier defiance. Later a chengguan is rebuked by a superior for suggesting that the Wang family are sincerely grateful. Their emotions are not of interest, snaps the official: "What we want is their obedience to our management."
This brilliant film explains a seeming puzzle: the hard men who run China are capable of both brutality and pragmatism. The key is their obsession with social stability. To buy peace, China's autocrats tolerate and even reward some forms of disobedience, so long as the game ends with displays of deference to their authority. Their goal, though, is the maintenance of power. Like an eagle adjusting its grip, the party is not guided by mercy.

全文文献: Headnote Party praise for covid-fighting doctors does little to fix China's ailing health system
The chínese language is rich in concise, sardonic sayings, many of which reflect universal truths. It also includes lots of phrases steeped in a world view that is distinct to China. One such is yi buguo erdai, meaning "no doctor's child becomes a doctor . This may be accompanied by a cynical shrug, perhaps after reading about the latest Chinese hospital boss arrested for bribe-taking or a fresh scandal involving fake medicines. The saying is also used on hearing news outlets describe another stabbing or assault of a doctor at work-for fully two-thirds of doctors told the Chinese Medical Doctor Association in 2017 that they had been attacked or threatened in a hospital, often by their patients' angry relatives. Small wonder that in one survey after another, few want their children to be
doctors. Elsewhere, doctoring is such a family business that journals of medical ethics devote papers to the subject. One such study found that one in five American medical students has a parent who is a physician. In China the profession is neither very prestigious nor especially well paid: even senior doctors typically earn just over 100,000 yuan ($14,500) a year-hardly a fortune in a big
city. Then came covid-19. Communist Party leaders have declared their handling of the virus a triumph, and are willing to give doctors and nurses a share of the credit. Much of China feels normal now, even celebratory. Case numbers are so low that authorities are easing strict lockdowns and border closures imposed months ago, though they are in no hurry to dismantle digital tracing systems that oblige urbanites to scan qr codes with a smartphone when entering a public building or taking a train or
aeroplane. Early cover-ups, which saw officials in the city of Wuhan conceal the severity of the outbreak for weeks, punishing doctors who sounded the alarm, have no place in official narratives. Medals and honours have, however, been bestowed upon selected, stateapproved doctors and scientists who prodded the central authorities to act. A new art exhibition at the National Museum in Beijing, devoted to covid-fighting medics, opens with a giant portrait of Zhong Nanshan, a celebrated 83-year-old lung doctor who used his seniority to reveal in late January, on national television, that covid-19 was spreading between people. The doctor, depicted against a stormy sky, his eyes brimming with tears, is captioned: "Communist Party member, Zhong Nanshan . Another artwork depicts young doctors from an elite Beijing hospital taking a break from volunteer service in Wuhan to express their patriotic fervour in a letter to the party chief, Xi Jinping. The show is reserved for Chinese nationals, so Chaguan has seen only photographs of his favourite work, a Tibetan scroll-painting, or tangka, showing three figures in traditional robes prodding leering, cartoon-like coronavirus spheres into a fiery pit, watched by a yak in
a face-mask. Propaganda about heroes in white coats has filled state media for months. It seems to have resonated. Zhang Shuyang, dean of China's most highly regarded medical school, Xiehe, told state television that applications to her college and its sister academy at Tsinghua University, also in Beijing, are up 30% since
last year. Yet other experts on China's health system express caution. Praising heroic doctors from well-known, elite hospitals does nothing to solve the big, structural problem with China's health system, and may even make it worse. Access to good care is shockingly uneven, with a vast gulf of quality between big-city hospitals and the rest. That prompts the public to seek care at a few, overcrowded urban hospitals, sometimes queuing for days to see a doctor for a 90-second consultation. What China really needs is clinics in small towns and villages that people actually want
to use. Distrust of local medicine is well founded. In 2016 just 0.2% of rural doctors in village clinics held at least a bachelor of science degree in medicine. Even in township-level health centres, only just under half of doctors in general practice (known as family medicine in America) are
university graduates. China's best medical colleges are trying to set eight years of training as a norm. But despite schemes offering tuition-free medical education to those willing to work in rural areas, most graduates want jobs in large cities. "You have got to develop adequate incentives for medical graduates to go back to the countryside and serve the people, says Tang Shenglan of Duke University in North Carolina. Perhaps a third of medical graduates never practise as doctors. Big-city hospital jobs are hard to land, and county general hospitals struggle to recruit new graduates, who can earn more as pharmaceutical sales reps. In the profession overall, "morale is not high, honestly speaking , says Professor Tang. Until China reforms the way that hospitals are financed, even doctors with "good hearts will face pressure to earn revenues for their department (and performance-related pay for themselves and their colleagues) by over-prescribing
drugs, tests and surgical
operations. First, do no harm Liu Tingfang, a professor of hospital management at Tsinghua University, worries that relations between anxious patients and harried hospital doctors are "not nice any more . To repair them, the public needs to believe that hospitals care about more than making money, he says. For doctors to be respected, they must be better paid and allowed to seek more than one legal income source, as in the West. Otherwise, post-covid, "things will go back to
where they were, the professor frets. Another Chinese saying holds that "seeing a doctor is hard and expensive . Working patiently to retire that phrase is not as exciting as staging patriotic exhibitions about covid-fighting heroes. But it is the key to reducing cruel inequalities that too often make sickness a financial catastrophe, and poverty a death sentence. For years China's priority has been shiny high-speed trains, Olympic stadiums and aircraft-carriers to awe the world. A

全文文献: Headnote China's rulers will get away with repression in Hong Kong, but will pay a price in the long term
The world has a right to be shocked by China's rapid crushing of civic freedoms in Hong Kong. But outsiders should not be surprised. Western politicians spent years arguing that China, out of pure self-interest, should grant Hong Kong greater autonomy, or at least preserve liberties promised by the slogan "One Country, Two Systems". That was always a doomed effort. In part, pleas to grant Hong Kong more freedoms reflected a misjudgment about the incentives that guide the swaggering-yet-paranoid hard men who lead China's Communist Party today. In part, Western arguments were a bluff, based on half-veiled threats that multinational companies, foreign investors and banks might walk away from Hong Kong's lucrative financial markets if the territory's political freedoms were too brutally curbed. China is now calling that bluff.
There is a self-reinforcing logic to China's actions. A sweeping national-security law imposed on Hong Kong in July has, by the mere fact of its existence, created a new test of patriotism that citizens must pass. Hong Kong's election officers recently disqualified a dozen pro-democracy politicians from seeking seats in the city's Legislative Council at elections scheduled for September. The candidates' purported misdeeds included questioning the need for a national-security law. Circular logic even saw opposition politicians disqualified for pledging to vote against the government. Just in case some missed the message, a day later the election, during which opposition parties expected to make big gains, was postponed for a year, ostensibly as a pandemic-fighting precaution.
Chinese officials do not much care if Westerners are outraged. Casting Hong Kong protesters as dupes, officials claim (and may even believe) that the Trump administration is using the city's openness to attempt a "colour revolution", in cahoots with such democracy supporters as Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong newspaper owner arrested and paraded through his newsroom in handcuffs by 200 policemen. Other officials are coldly cynical. They think that lots of foreign governments and businesses mostly want to make money in Hong Kong. Cynics also think that many expatriates quietly opposed last year's anti-government protests, some of which were violent, and will welcome the silencing of troublemakers.
Nor do Chinese leaders seem scared that repression in Hong Kong will cost them hearts and minds in Taiwan, though that democratic island was once promised that, if it agrees to rule by Beijing, it will have its own version of "One Country, Two Systems". On the mainland, senior figures have told Westerners that the Taiwanese will soon envy Hong Kong's renewed prosperity. Chinese leaders "are feeling quite triumphant over Hong Kong", says a diplomat. "They think it's theirs and this is what they have to do."
China's rulers are half-right. Hong Kong is theirs. It also matters more to them than it does to any foreign government (especially with covid-19 battering economies). That includes the government of Britain, the city's former colonial master. Britain has offered a path to citizenship for up to 3m Hong Kongers, drawing Chinese rebukes. However, it is also anxious to promote trade with China, especially after Brexit. On July 28th European Union foreign ministers expressed "grave concern" about the national-security law, but could not agree on concrete, joint actions. Indeed, in Beijing, some European diplomats privately call Hong Kong an obsession of the Anglophone world. Japan is both unhappy about Hong Kong, a close partner, and unwilling to do much about it.
Narrowly, China's rulers will get away with crushing Hong Kong's freedoms. But in myriad, hard-to-quantify ways, they will pay a price. Chinese officials are quick to allege impure motives when outsiders express concern for Hong Kong. Britain is called nostalgic for its empire. The Global Times, a party tabloid, calls Mr Lai a "traitor to the Chinese race" for his past appeals for foreign support. But it is not race treachery if Hong Kongers make common cause with democrats overseas. Nor is it racism if Westerners find Hong Kong the most comprehensible place in China.
Party bosses and their apologists love to play up China's exceptionalism. They call authoritarianism a reflection of China's vast size, its poverty, its history or even its collectivist, Confucian culture. Such excuses do not work as well in Hong Kong. A modern, remarkably open world city, its hybrid culture includes many familiar, Western-style freedoms. That legibility makes its fate unusually important in shaping foreign perceptions of China.
A question of trust
Chinese officials insist that last year's protests were a bid to split the motherland and seek Hong Kong's secession. In truth, only a small minority of Hong Kongers support independence, a hopeless dream. Protesters last year talked more about democracy as a way to preserve liberties meant to last until 2047. Those include a raucous free press to hold the powerful to account, schools and universities with a mandate to inculcate critical thinking in the young, and a rule of law in which individuals have inalienable rights. British colonial rulers denied Hong Kong real democracy. But when given the chance to cast meaningful ballots, most voters have consistently supported more direct elections. Now China's rulers have made their preference clear. They hate to be defied and loathe losing elections, so are rolling Hong Kong's freedoms back.
Western governments and people cannot alter China's choices in Hong Kong. But they are entitled to draw conclusions from those decisions. China wants to become a high-technology superpower, selling the world 5G networks, nuclear-power stations or- who knows-a covid-19 vaccine. China's diplomats want a seat at the top table in global forums where standards and norms are agreed upon. Its universities want to strike partnerships with academic institutions around the world. Those are all reasonable ambitions, but they depend heavily on trust. Repression in Hong Kong will have an outsize impact on whether foreigners trust China. That may anger party bosses. It should not be a surprise.

全文文献: Headnote Only five blind students took China's university entrance exam this year. What a waste of potential
Several startling things awaited 20 blind Chinese youngsters attending a residential course that began in Shanghai this week, designed to prepare them for university. Adult instructors, many of them also blind, broached topics that protective parents rarely raise, from the rules of raucous student party-games to the perils of falling in love. Learning to navigate a campus alone is not just about finding libraries or canteens, noted Yang Qingfeng of Golden Cane, the charity organising the course. It is pretty vital if teenagers ever hope to go on unchaperoned dates.
In pep talks, students were urged to think beyond the few careers traditionally offered to blind Chinese. Since the 1950s, when China opened vocational schools for disabled war veterans, the visually impaired have typically been pushed to become musicians or, above all, to work as masseurs in state-run clinics or private parlours. People may say there is nothing wrong with being a masseur, a rapt audience heard from Cai Cong, who attended a blindmassage college a decade ago before persuading his parents to let him work as a radio journalist. Well that is fine, said Mr Cai-as long as it is your choice.
Several students, all neatly clad in black trousers and yellow polo shirts, admitted to nerves about the final test of the course. It will involve leaving the hotel alone to find a place to eat in central Shanghai, trailed by sighted volunteers who will intervene only if danger looms. Yet the real novelty of the course is arguably simpler. For this small group of youngsters-at once unusually brave and at the same time awkward and quick to dissolve in nervous giggling-the course promises seven days focused on what they can do, not on things deemed unwise, unsafe or beyond them.
This is almost certainly the best moment to be blind in Chinese history. The past was often exceedingly grim. Chinese literature is filled with stories of blind people who survive by begging or telling fortunes. As modern China grew more prosperous and opened to the world, it built special schools for the handicapped and, by ratifying such agreements as the un Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, gave domestic reformers new, albeit limited leverage to press for change. In 2014 China announced that blind students would be allowed to take the national university entrance examination, the fearsome gaokao. This breakthrough followed years of official foot-dragging. In 2015 almost 9.5m candidates took the exam. Just eight students took a special version in Braille or large print. No official count of blind school-pupils exists in China. But if the proportion of American youngsters with legally registered visual handicaps is taken as a guide, as many as 80,000 of those taking the gaokao each year should be blind.
Alas, this also remains a frustrating moment to be blind and Chinese. Of 10.7m students who sat the gaokao this summer, just five took the Braille papers for the blind. Since 2015 candidate numbers have never exceeded ten in a single year, leading some Chinese to grumble about "wasting national resources on the Braille gaokao, says Mr Cai. That ignores other hurdles still to be dismantled, he argues, noting that only about 30 Chinese universities admit blind students, and that even some of those fail to offer accessible tests and textbooks on a systematic basis. Other universities exclude the blind with medical tests and other gambits. Education officials do see a need to look after the disabled, he says. The problem is low expectations, and an attitude towards the blind and others that "what we give you is what's best for you. Doctors play a role in making families timid, too, says Mr Cai, who lost his sight at ten. Once they decide a progressive disability cannot be cured, they too often abandon hope and counsel risk-avoidance.
Nonetheless a handful of blind students manage to stay in the mainstream school system and achieve gaokao scores that entitle them to apply for elite colleges, a feat that reflects luck, talent but also years of grinding toil. One such student, Ang Ziyu, a serious youth from the inland city of Hefei, is attending the Shanghai training course. He must wait until late August to learn if his score of 635 is enough to enter Beijing Normal University, a teachertraining school. He expects no special allowance to be made for years of having schoolwork read to him by his parents, or the trickiness of taking the gaokao in Braille, a tactile form of printing that is ill-suited to transliterating Chinese characters. Mr Ang currently leans towards teaching at a blind school after graduation. But he has heard that attending college often leaves students eager to explore new possibilities. "I feel like that, too, he says shyly.
The soft bigotry of low expectations
Each year a few hundred blind students take simplified admissions tests set by special disabled colleges or sections of ordinary universities. That is the path taken by Zhang Shuxin and Huang Kan, two teenage girls from the southern province of Guangdong. Speaking at the Shanghai training camp, they volunteer that the education they received at high schools for the blind was "vastly different from that of a normal senior school. Ms Zhang plans to be a music teacher. Already her father has offered to buy her a flat so she need not worry about earning a living-an offer not open to her two younger brothers. Indeed, her mother was reluctant even to let her attend the course in Shanghai, thinking it risky.
Ms Huang's parents would not let her attend an ordinary high school. "They worried I would get in danger or impair my vision further, she says, conceding: "A lot of us have lived a very closedoff life since we were young. She credits the internet and screenreading software with connecting her to the world. She hopes to become a psychotherapist, and to help other Chinese know that the blind are as capable as others. "I have a lot of dreams, she says. Unexpectedly, the thought brings on tears, but she wants no sympathy, instead apologising for her loss of control. These stubborn, impressive students know what they need: equal chances to show what they can do. Pity is of no use to them.

全文文献: Headnote Officials claim an archaeological site proves that China has 5,000 years of continuous history
In the tight-knit world of Chinese archaeology, a sign of a dig's importance is the sight of Zhou Mingsheng at work. A sun-battered, tousle-haired field technician who has worked at excavations all around China, "Master Zhou" is credited with the gentlest touch in his profession. Born into a farming family, he is a "national-level craftsman" with a talent for using simple tools-a trowel and soft brush-to extract relics that would crumble in other hands, says his current boss, Wang Xu, director of an archaeological site at Shuanghuaishu, a Neolithic settlement near the Yellow River in the central province of Henan.
Master Zhou's presence, quietly supervising local villagers as they scrape at the hard-packed soil, is not the only proof that this hilltop site has the attention of high-ranking officials. Since digging began in 2013, funding has increased greatly. Sturdy roofs cover much of the site. Vaulted living quarters have been built into a hillside, keeping them cool in summer heat and cosy in winter frosts. A spell at Shuanghuaishu is a prize for top students at Peking University, the country's most prestigious college. Visits by Chinese dignitaries are a weekly routine.
It is not beauty that lures visitors to Shuanghuaishu. At 5,300 years old, the settlement is the work of a culture too simple to have left behind exquisite bronzes or written inscriptions. The single most precious find, to date, is a finger-length sculpture of a silkworm, carved out of the tusk of a boar. Nor is the setting lovely: a scrubby plateau patrolled by dragonflies and deafening crickets, between a highway and two power stations. Rather, the site's importance is historical, and thus political. For since the birth of Chinese archaeology in the 1920s, it has been inseparable from claims that China boasts the oldest unbroken civilisation on Earth.
That question caused a genteel tussle between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, during a state visit in 2017. As the pair explored the Forbidden City in Beijing, Mr Trump ventured that he had heard that China has 5,000 years of history, but that Egypt has 8,000. "Egypt is a bit more ancient," Mr Xi replied. "But the only continuous civilisation to carry onwards is China." Shuanghuaishu is now part of that debate. Leading archaeologists say that the site boasts the right combination of location, age, grandeur and distinctive cultural elements to be the capital of an early Chinese kingdom. That would make it a bridge between China's written history, which stretches back 3,000 years, and the era of the Yellow Emperor, who by tradition ruled over these fertile central plains almost five millennia ago, though many foreign scholars have the impudence to dismiss him as a myth. State media call the site proof of China's 5,000 years of history.
Master Zhou began his career in 1979. He is too diplomatic to say so, but that was a period of cautious rebuilding for Chinese archaeology, after the relic-smashing frenzies of the Maoist era. Back then ancient treasures, if displayed at all, were labelled as evidence of feudal oppression. By the late 1990s patriotic education had replaced class warfare as a favoured tool for mobilising the masses. In 1995 a deputy prime minister, Song Jian, was mortified during a visit to Egypt, where officials showed him a detailed timeline of the pharaohs extending back 4,700 years. He returned arguing that China needed similarly precise dates for its dynasties, writing that history without chronology "can only be called rumour or myth". The central government tasked a team of 200 archaeologists, historians and other scholars with assigning firm dates to the earliest dynasties listed in classical histories, the Xia, Shang and Zhou. That multi-year project ended with official Chinese declarations of success, and a start date for the Xia dynasty four millennia ago. In contrast, many foreign scholars question to this day whether proof of the Xia has been found.
A second national project to research the origins of Chinese civilisation followed from 2002 to 2015. It was given a further boost by President Xi's launch in 2013 of a globe-spanning infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road Initiative, with its talk of reviving ancient trade routes along the Silk Road. Mr Wang recalls how those twin quests to find silk-producing kingdoms led archaeologists to Shuanghuaishu, and then in 2016, to two nearby sites where small urns turned out to hold children buried in silken funeral wrappings. He lists signs of Shuanghuaishu's sophistication, from its large houses to neatly dug tombs, some containing residents who lived to the then-astonishing age of 40 and have the slender torsos of those spared hard labour. A series of pots was found buried in the precise shape of the plough, a constellation. Foreigners carp about a lack of written records, Mr Wang notes. Perhaps they are missing symbols that will one day be deciphered, for instance in patterned pottery. Maybe the Yellow Emperor was not a literal person, but a tribe. Outsiders "can't keep using Western standards to apply to Chinese ruins," he argues.
Whose emperor are you calling mythical?
To foreigners, a final puzzle remains. Shuanghuaishu is an interesting place. But so are lots of other Chinese sites of the same period. Wang Wei, director of the Institute of Archaeology at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (cass), agrees that similar artefacts-from jade carvings to images of dragons-have been found in several sites dating back five or six millennia. That would seem to bolster those scholars who compare early China to a "starry sky" filled with competing cultures. But unity is what interests Mr Wang. In time, he says: "the stars gathered in central China, and a nation was built on top." Shuanghuaishu matters because it lies in that central cradle of national greatness. Chinese archaeology has three main missions, says the cass archaeology boss. The first two are studying human development and agriculture. But the most important is studying the origins of Chinese civilisation. If that sounds like a political answer, in China history and politics are inseparable. And that has been true for thousands of years.

全文文献: Headnote A blood-drenched television thriller asks hard questions about right and wrong
In theory "The Bad Kids", this summer's most talked-about Chinese television drama, is a thriller about a teacher turned mass killer, matching wits with three plucky children in a quiet coastal town. In practice, like all really successful horror stories, the 12part series is also a window onto things that frighten people in their everyday lives. A case can be made that the drama-despite its impressive body-count and inventive murder locations (a seafood buffet will never look the same again)-is really a meditation about how hard it is to be a good parent, or a good person, in a society that is as competitive, stressful and unequal as modern China.
In an era when entertainers are under ever-stricter orders to promote "positive energy" and the joys of Communist Party rule, that is quite a subversive theme. As a result, "The Bad Kids" offers a case-study about how clever film-makers must operate in the China of 2020. A sensitive, complex examination of the human condition, it is sprinkled with upbeat, censor-friendly details, some of them jarringly at odds with the rest of the plot. The trade-offs have worked. Official news outlets have praised the series. The Chinese public, for their part, have also given it an exceptionally high score of 8.9 out of 10 on Douban, a big online rating site.
Censorship-wise, it helps that the drama unfolds over the course of a sweltering summer about 20 years ago, so that scenes showing violent gangsters and loan sharks do not reflect on today's leaders. Indeed, it is possible to enjoy the show for its nostalgic recreation of a simpler China where childhood friends might spend a hot night climbing rooftops or sharing lurid soft drinks from glass bottles, rather than sitting in lonely silence as many might now, gazing at smartphone screens. Some compromises are easy to spot. Notably, the show depicts small-town policemen as kindly paragons, bringing justice and comfort to the people of Ningzhou, the fictional port where the killer works as a maths teacher. Historians of corruption remember the era differently.
The drama is adapted from a novel by Zijin Chen, a dark study of evil, both adult and juvenile. The screen version, made by iQiyi, a Netflix-like streaming video company, depicts its three young heroes as mostly well-intentioned rebels, one of whom is tempted by evil. The other two speak with a moral clarity that eludes many adults in the show. Repeatedly, the murderous teacher plays on the power of education to change lives in China. He distracts a suspicious policeman with advice about his daughter's maths grades, and offers free tutoring to the children who have rumbled him. His youngest tormentor, a sweet-natured girl known as Pupu, sternly replies: "Is school where you learned to kill people?"
In the book, the children are angry victims of adult betrayal, ranging from sexual abuse to being disowned by a divorced father. Two youths in the novel are the children of murderers, executed by the state. The television drama offers a nuanced view of parenthood. Viewers see the flaws of a mother whom society might call a model parent, pushing her clever son to study until his bedroom is filled with academic trophies. He will have time for friends once he has a good job, the mother snaps at a teacher concerned by her son's loneliness. Yet that mother is scared, not wicked. Divorced from a cheating husband, she sees education as a way to armour her son against a harsh world. "Promise you will be safe," she tells her child. They are the most loving words she utters.
One question comes up time and again: what does it mean to be good? Scenes of supposed hospitality-banquets at which the young are handed cash in red envelopes, or junior family members are bullied to drink alcohol-are exposed as cold and empty. "A man without ambition isn't a man," the maths teacher is told at a dinner, as in-laws dissect his career prospects. The drama challenges the idea that respectability and virtue are earned by fulfilling the family, social and professional obligations that cost ordinary Chinese so much time and agony.
Only connect
Even the law offers little help in defining virtue. "Whether your dad is a good or a bad person is decided by a judge, not by you or me," a gruff policeman tells Yan Liang, a prisoner's child. He is proved wrong when Yan Liang's father, a gangster sent to a mental hospital with drug-induced brain damage, redeems himself with a fleeting, almost miraculous proof of love for his son.
Several characters gain moral authority through such private yet sincere acts of affection. Viewers mostly respect a police captain because they see his sweet, bantering-yet-supportive relationship with his daughter, not because he has stars on his epaulettes. Yan Liang, a ragged teenage runaway, steals a blanket for Pupu and agonises aloud about following his father into criminality. When put to a life-and-death test, though, he does the right thing. "I didn't become a bad person," he gasps with relief to the gruff policeman who has become a mentor. It is a moving moment. The censors' hand can be felt soon afterwards, when Yan Liang abruptly declares an ambition to join the police as an adult.
Devoted fans, including a Chinese-Canadian blogger about television who uses the name AvenueX, suggest that attentive viewers can see alternative endings hidden among the uplifting patriotism. Notably, AvenueX points to clues that several characters die before the drama ends and should now be understood as ghosts, visible only to those who care for them. Her arguments are plausible, though the film-makers have rejected such theories.
Truth is a slippery concept in "The Bad Kids". Many lies are told, sometimes for selfish reasons, but also for fear of losing something precious. Truth-telling is at its most admirable when offered as an act of love, for instance by a child who cannot bear the loneliness of deceiving a parent for ever. This is a messy moral code, far from the tidy, flag-waving pieties favoured by party chiefs. The show's popularity is cheering. In a China that rings with the din of patronising, bossy propaganda, viewers crave a bit of messiness.

全文文献: Headnote Millions of Chinese have studied in America over decades. That bond is in peril
The first Chinese graduate from an American university, Yung Wing, deemed his college years the great adventure of his life. Alas, his graduation from Yale in 1854, sponsored by missionaries who spotted his talents as a boy in rural Guangdong, was a high point. Soon political mistrust and prejudice, both in America and China, filled his life with setbacks. These included the ending of his scheme that involved bringing 30 Chinese youths to America each year. Back in Beijing, imperial mandarins saw value in the science that the youngsters studied in New England. These officials were especially eager to take up a promise that the military academies of West Point and Annapolis would admit Chinese cadets. Then, in a mark of disdain for the ailing Qing empire, America broke that promise. Mandarins were further appalled by the irreverent, sports-loving, churchgoing Yankee ways picked up by Yung's charges. In 1881they summoned the boys home in disgrace. Yung lost his American citizenship to a xenophobic law passed a year later, the Chinese Exclusion Act.
Yung would recognise the pressures his Chinese heirs face today. In the coming weeks many will have to decide how and whether to pursue studies in America. They are living through a moment when campuses, borders and minds on both sides of the Pacific are being closed by mutual suspicion (including overly sweeping American fears about on-campus espionage) and a pandemic.
There are currently 370,000 Chinese students and fresh graduates in America without an easy route home, after China slashed international flights as a covid precaution. Many who plan to stay face months of online study while campuses remain shut. On July 6th American immigration officials caused panic (and a lawsuit from Harvard University, among others) by declaring that unless foreign students in America attend some in-person classes next term they risk deportation. Another 50,000 Chinese would normally take up new places at American universities this autumn, but visa offices at America's missions in China are closed, with no word on when they will open. Parents will soon receive tuition bills for the next semester, often for tens of thousands of dollars, even if their child can only watch virtual lectures at home in China.
This is a crisis with large effects, unevenly distributed. Some American schools are offering classes on Chinese satellite campuses, such as New York University Shanghai. Cornell has announced a "Study Away" scheme, allowing students in China to take a mix of American and local classes at prestigious universities in Beijing and other cities. Many wealthy, well-connected Chinese with places at top colleges are not ready to give up their American dreams. Talk to such students and their families, and what they are really describing is a larger plan to become world citizens, of which a degree is one part. Elite Chinese call America a place to learn critical thinking, build social networks, and secure credentials that will help land them jobs and perhaps green cards.
Elle, 18, attends the international section of a top-ranked high school in Beijing, where fees run to 160,000 yuan ($22,800) a year. She has an offer from New York University and wants to accept it. Rival countries do not appeal. Australia is for "those with bad exam results," she says over coffee in a smart Beijing suburb. In Canada, she adds: "There are so many Chinese students that you don't even have a chance to speak English." As for Britain, she attended summer school there, but sensed coldness towards foreigners. "I like America more than the uk, I think I am accepted there."
Elle's older brother is studying in New York and wanted to stay, even after rioters smashed windows in his building. "It's one thing after the other," sighs Elle's mother. She remembers holidays in America when the country seemed great "in every way". But officials there have "failed quite badly on fighting covid", she laments. She is shocked by ordinary Americans refusing to wear masks. Still, she thinks America offers chances that a Chinese education cannot, starting with the different, thought-provoking ideas that her children may encounter. "It's more of a globalised experience."
Families are hedging bets. Half of this year's 150 clients of Elite Scholars of China, an education counselling service focused on the Ivy League and its ilk, also applied to non-American universities. In the end, though, only four took up places outside America, says Tomer Rothschild, the firm's co-founder.
Another perspective comes from a larger group: middle-class students from provincial cities, heading to mid-ranked American colleges. To generalise, this group is less likely to enthuse about Western freedoms, from raucous debates to an uncensored internet. Their focus is on which degree will boost their earning power when they return to China to compete with local graduates.
Yes, Chinese teens know Donald Trump calls covid "kung flu"
Just now America is doing a remarkable job of making foreign students feel unwelcome. Chinese state media happily reinforce the message, with lavish reporting of American riots, anti-Chinese racism, gun violence and covid infections. Any decoupling may take time to be visible. Francis Miller, a college counsellor based in Xi'an, a western city, notes that the Chinese students he helps have to enroll in special international streams that prepare them for the sat or other foreign exams from the age of 15 or so. That amounts to a commitment to study abroad, because they are abandoning the fearsome, three-year gaokao curriculum that governs entry to Chinese universities. Future trends are ominous. In the eastern city of Nanjing, a college-entry coach says her employer's new-client numbers are down by two-thirds in a year.
Yung Wing wanted more Chinese to enjoy an American education to make his country "enlightened and powerful". His dream involved risks for both sides. America was being asked to help China rise. Chinese rulers had to let youngsters taste new freedoms. Soon afterwards, leaders in both countries rejected that bargain. Over a century later, a folly repeated is still a mistake.

全文文献: To repair transatlantic alliances, countries should co-operate in their handling of China
In recent days, as China prepared to turn Hong Kong into a cowed simulacrum of a world city-a shiny stage-set of modernity, run from the shadows by the mainland's hard men-Chaguan asked Western envoys in Beijing how their countries might respond. Several chose to hear and answer a different question, namely, how might their government make China change course?
Be realistic, such diplomats sighed. China will impose this national-security law on Hong Kong. What would you have us do? Other well-placed foreigners in China are still more fatalistic about the West's ability to influence China. That is true whether they are being asked about repression in Hong Kong or about Xinjiang, the far-western region that China has turned into a police state. It is shocking enough that over 1m members of Xinjiang's mostly Muslim Uighur minority have been locked in re-education camps in recent years, suspected of extremism for praying or even wearing beards. On June 30th the Associated Press reported on an official campaign to force abortions and sterilisations on Uighur women, causing birth rates to plunge 24% in Xinjiang last year. Ask Westerners in Beijing about such painful subjects, and they cite forecasts that in coming years China will account for 30% of global economic growth. In a pandemic-induced recession, when millions of workers are losing their jobs, they reason, what government will sacrifice livelihoods on the altar of Hong Kong's freedoms or Chinese human rights?
That maximalist framing of the China debate-pretending that any criticism of Chinese actions amounts to a futile call for changing China's worldview, or even its political system-is in reality a cop-out, a convenient way to rationalise impotence. Chinese officials try a similar trick. They have spent decades accusing the West of plotting regime change, whenever democratic leaders object to any Chinese action. Actually, far from trying to contain China, for 40 years Americans and Europeans ignored endless provocations and broken promises in the hope that as the country grew richer it would open, and be more willing to co-operate on tackling climate change, nuclear non-proliferation or other global public goods.
Now America has a president, Donald Trump, who shows no interest in Chinese repression and scorns global goods, but whose administration does include true China hawks who regard Communist Party rule as inherently immoral. That has led to policies of unprecedented toughness, delivered with never-seen-before incoherence. Mr Trump mostly wants China to buy more American stuff, notably farm goods grown by Trump voters. To prise open Chinese wallets, Mr Trump has imposed punitive tariffs on Chinese goods and allowed hawkish underlings to enact offensive policies aimed at constraining China's rise. America has banned exports of semiconductors and other sensitive goods to China, and formally declared such technology giants as Huawei to be a threat to national security. Visas for Chinese students and journalists have been limited and sanctions promised on Chinese officials responsible for abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
Bluster from Trump administration hawks, undercut by a president who cares little for principles, did nothing to slow China's rush to impose authoritarian rule by law on Hong Kong. Fatalistic Westerners may feel vindicated, muttering that nothing can be done to change China's ways. But changing China is not the only marker of success. A new paper by François Godemont of the Institut Montaigne in Paris describes Europe and America's poor record of agreeing on, let alone imposing, policies that force China to do things. Mr Godemont is pitilessly clear-eyed about how China has fobbed Europe off with unkept promises and empty dialogues.
Yet if Europe is bad at offensive moves, it is doing better at defence. No player matters more than Germany. It accounts for almost 43% of the European Union's exports to China, and is duly wary of confrontation (German officials shun eu language calling China a "systemic rival"). Still, Germany has joined eu institutions, France and others in tightening investment rules to shield covid-battered tech firms from being snapped up. New eu rules on procurement and scientific co-operation stress transparency and the protection of intellectual property. The European Commission is to ask eu countries to approve curbs on foreign subsidies. Such defences against Chinese predations give the eu leverage.
Calling China out for its abuses is a good first step
A second reason to eschew fatalism is that next year America may have a new president, Joe Biden, committed to repairing transatlantic relations. Though Mr Biden spent years engaging with China, as a senator and vice-president, America has changed. Both parties see China as a strategic competitor. Highlighting their differences with Mr Trump, Democrats are keen to challenge autocrats and speak up for political freedoms.
Shared concerns about China could be a catalyst for renewed transatlantic co-operation, argues a new paper, "Dealing with the Dragon, China as a Transatlantic Challenge", produced by the Asia Society Centre on us-China relations, the Bertelsmann Foundation in Germany and George Washington University. Differences remain. Broadly, Europeans see China's rise as an economic threat, while Americans see a national-security challenge. Europeans are wary of offensive policies like export controls on high-tech goods. The Trump era has left a legacy of deep distrust. Still, the paper notes, America and Europe would gain by co-ordinating defences. A joint agenda could include sharing intelligence about cyber-security, Chinese investments and technological standard-setting, as well as about tireless Chinese attempts to co-opt or control international organisations, from the un to the Arctic Council.
China is convinced that its interests are served by iron-fisted repression at home and bullying abroad. The West will not browbeat China into reading its interests differently. But democracies can build joint defences. That is already a worthy goal.

全文文献: Headnote Corruption is bad, but in the past it emboldened some Chinese officials to take useful risks
IN CHINESE, AN official sacked for corruption is said to have "fallen off a horse". The phrase rings with the age-old satisfaction of watching the high and mighty plunge face-first into mud.
Eight years after its launch by President Xi Jinping, the largest anti-corruption campaign in Chinese history remains wildly popular, notably because it has unhorsed not just light-fingered Communist Party chiefs in villages, but big-city mayors and members of the Politburo. More than 1.5m individuals have been disciplined for graft since 2012, including both "tigers and flies"-a phrase favoured by Mr Xi who took power that year. Still, a puzzle lurks within that mood of public glee at seeing the haughty-but-dirty brought low. The puzzle is identified in a thought-provoking new book, "China's Gilded Age: The Paradox of Economic Boom and Vast Corruption", by Yuen Yuen Ang of the University of Michigan.
To Chinese rulers, the cupidity of the country's 50m party functionaries, civil servants and local officials is a political crisis. Shortly after becoming party leader, Mr Xi declared that corruption was "utterly destructive politically, shocking people to the core". As Ms Ang notes, the consensus among development agencies and scholars is that corruption hurts economic growth. Yet it is not hard to find ordinary Chinese who miss some big tigers brought down for graft. Exploring that puzzle, Ms Ang lists the achievements of Bo Xilai, the charismatic son of a revolutionary pioneer. As party secretary of Chongqing, Mr Bo transformed that giant inland city with foreign investments and a debt-fuelled construction boom, before being purged and jailed in 2012.
Mr Bo is accused of taking gifts ranging from a villa in France to the fees for his son's education at Harrow, a British boarding school. But Chongqing also remembers him for new roads, airports, parks, hospitals and housing for hard-up residents. The book describes other swashbuckling, risk-taking leaders who were toppled for corruption but are still remembered fondly. One such is Ji Jianye, who transformed several cities in the eastern province of Jiangsu, earning the mostly admiring nickname "Mayor Bulldozer". To Ms Ang, their careers reveal something important about Chinese corruption, and how it manages to be both rampant and co-existent with 40 years of rapid economic expansion.
Arguing that conventional measures of corruption are too crude, Ms Ang "unbundles" graft into four varieties. First there is petty theft. Perhaps involving a traffic policeman demanding and pocketing a fine, such corruption poisons economies. Then there is grand theft, eg, a dictator looting the central bank. That is also toxic to economies. Third is speed money, as when a shopkeeper pays a bribe for a permit that might otherwise never arrive. Ms Ang compares this to a painkiller that eases the agony of bad governance but cures nothing. Then comes the variety that most worries Mr Xi: access money, or high-level bribes and favours offered to powerful officials and their families, in return for contracts or other privileges. Ms Ang compares this sort of corruption to steroids. Access money can promote private investment and economic growth. That helps explain the popularity of some bent officials.
The book is not a defence of corruption. Like steroids, access money promotes unbalanced growth, it notes. Often such graft directs funds towards property deals, a swift route to riches for officials in China, where land use is state-controlled. China is especially prone to this fourth category, though petty corruption has declined over the past 20 years, thanks to dull but important things like hard-to-cheat government book-keeping. The Global Corruption Barometer, a survey by Transparency International, found that 26% of Chinese had paid a bribe to use public services in 2017, well below levels found in Vietnam or Cambodia.
Ms Ang compares China's early phase of economic opening to America's Gilded Age, when 19th-century robber barons suborned politicians to let them build railways, private monopolies and commercial empires. Public anger prompted the transparency drives and social reforms of the 20th-century Progressive Era.
Relying on the bums to throw themselves out
Admirers of Mr Xi may call his anti-corruption campaign a new Progressive Era. Ms Ang is not so sure. For one thing, China lacks the muckraking journalists and throw-the-bums-out elections that helped America reform. In contrast, its purge is secretive and top-down. Studying 54 city-level party secretaries felled for corruption, Ms Ang finds a correlation with the sacking of a mentor above them in provincial patronage networks. Worse, Mr Xi has been "simultaneously straitjacketing the bureaucracy and clamping down on social and political freedoms", squeezing entrepreneurial impulses in business and civil society.
Ms Ang is convincing about the economic risks of Mr Xi's drive for conformity. But the party's focus on politics is also rational, says Feng Chucheng, a political-risk analyst at Plenum, an independent research company. He notes that historically lots of bribes were paid by one official to another to secure a promotion, rather than by entrepreneurs to enable economic development. Other abuses of power involved no cash at all: helping a relative jump the queue for housing or a rationed car licence plate, for instance. Indeed the public is arguably more angered by social inequalities than by embezzled money. Mr Feng cites a singer, Tong Zhuo, who casually boasted during a broadcast in May that rules were bent to secure his place at a famous drama school. Viewers erupted. To date, 21 officials in two provinces have been punished, including Mr Tong's stepfather, a mid-ranking party functionary.
One effect of the purge has both economic and political consequences. Officials at all levels of government are more risk-averse and reluctant to innovate, says Mr Feng. Ms Ang describes outright paralysis among decision-makers. She adds that corruption's true root cause is the state's enormous power over the economy. That, alas, is a horse that the party is unwilling to dismount.

全文文献: Headnote It sees a world distracted by covid-19, and too economically weak to hold it back
China is often called a country in thrall to nationalism. The reality is more complex than that, and more cynical. For proof, look at the remarkable calm (so far, at least) that has reigned since June 15th, when Chinese and Indian troops fought their deadliest border skirmish in almost half a century. On a sweltering afternoon in Beijing, nearly three days after that Himalayan clash, a couple of bored-looking police were the only sign of extra security around India's embassy.
China's state-run media had by then issued terse reports of a violent border incident. Lots of internet users reposted news items about dead Indian soldiers. There was only limited grumbling about the failure of official Chinese sources to reveal details of casualties suffered by the Chinese army. Indeed, some netizens treated the story as a joke, mocking India's soldiers as feeble.
Compare that muted response with the rage provoked last October by the manager of an American basketball team, Daryl Morey of the Houston Rockets, when he retweeted the slogan: "Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong", in support of anti-government protests in that territory. Millions of Chinese demanded Mr Morey's sacking. Within two days Chinese broadcasters announced that they would not show Rockets games.
Chinese nationalism is often compared to a tiger which Communist Party bosses have fed for years-and which they are now condemned to ride, for fear of being eaten if they dismount. In reality, popular nationalism resembles a deep, man-made reservoir, created by the damming-up and channelling of long-existing forces. Most of the time, Chinese leaders can restrain or unleash public rage at will. Only in the biggest crises do they feel constrained to open the floodgates to ease dangerous pressure.
Public grievances are especially strong when America, Japan or other much-condemned countries are involved. Chaguan was a reporter in Beijing in May 1999 when nato warplanes bombed China's embassy in Belgrade, killing three journalists. Chinese leaders dismissed American promises that this was an accident, and for four days let students hurl rocks at the American and British embassies. Violence was controlled like water from a tap. Smashing windows and diplomats' parked cars was allowed. But when youngsters tried to burn the American embassy's flag with a flaming rag on a long bamboo pole, Chaguan watched paramilitary police beat them back. "Traitors!" howled the crowd.
Often dismissed by Chinese as poor and chaotic, India is not in the rogue's gallery of imperialist bullies that China's young learn about at school. Vitally, two-way trade with India is rather modest: 11 countries are larger trade partners for China. All those factors leave Chinese rulers free to downplay a crisis with India. For even when China appears reckless, it is calculating rewards and risks.
Opportunistic yes, reckless no
A revealing paper published last year by Ketian Zhang of George Mason University, in Virginia, charts how China has been throwing its weight around in its region. Titled "Cautious Bully: Reputation, Resolve and Beijing's Use of Coercion in the South China Sea", it tests claims that China's willingness to use force is explained by its growing military strength or the assertiveness of its leaders. Actually, China used its armed forces more in 1990s, when they were weak, the paper notes. Today China prefers to use its coastguard, its maritime militia and other agencies to bully neighbours. China was rather aggressive under Hu Jintao, the country's distinctly cautious leader in 2002-12. Drawing on Chinese archives and interviews with officials, Ms Zhang offers a "cost-balancing theory" of decision-making: that China uses coercion "when the need to establish a reputation for resolve is high and the economic cost is low". Thus China was quiet in the South China Sea in the early 2000s, when it wanted a free-trade deal with the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Later it became assertive after deciding that this group needed Chinese trade more than the other way round-and had to be deterred from seeking international help in the South China Sea. China especially likes to inflict asymmetric economic pain, as when it banned imports of bananas from the Philippines during a territorial dispute in 2012, devastating Filipino farmers but barely hurting its own consumers.
That pattern continues. Recent Chinese boycotts have targeted things like Australian beef or Houston Rockets games, but not more vital commodities. All this casts another light on China's assertiveness during this pandemic year, and the notion that China is taking advantage of a world distracted by covid-19 to throw its weight around. It is true that China has been aggressive in recent months. Beyond its readiness to skirmish on the Indian border, it has decided to impose a draconian national-security law on Hong Kong, slapped trade boycotts on Australia and other Western nations, and sent coastguard ships to sink or harass foreign vessels in the contested waters of the South China Sea. It is also true that the world is geopolitically distracted. It is hard for governments to chide China over democracy in Hong Kong, say, while also negotiating to buy Chinese ventilators. But economics matters, too.
This is a time of slumping global demand for China's goods and interrupted supply chains. Chinese officials are betting on domestic demand to drive their country's recovery from covid-19. To control the virus, the mainland's borders are closed to almost all foreigners. Chinese parents are thinking twice about sending students to universities in America, Australia and Europe. Chinese officials growl that Hong Kong-based foreign banks must support the national-security law, for they are eminently replaceable.
All in all, China feels less reliant on other countries than it has for a while. That same China is also being unusually assertive. Follow the logic through, and having limited economic ties with China may not make other countries safer. India is the latest country to be confronted with that dilemma. It will not be the last.

全文文献: Headnote China's elites think Donald Trump is hastening his country's decline. Is that good news, they wonder?
Whom would China prefer as America's next president? That is a hard question, without an uplifting answer. In elite circles in Beijing, both President Donald Trump and his rival, Joe Biden, a former vice-president, are spoken of with distrust and condescension. Rather unusually, both candidates are known quantities. Each man has spent many hours with President Xi Jinping. During the first term of the Obama administration, when Mr Xi was heir-apparent to the leadership of China with the formal rank of vice-president, Mr Biden, as his opposite number, was tasked with taking his measure. Visiting China in 2011, Mr Biden hailed their numerous meetings in various countries and their "mutual respect". Mr Trump has gone further, calling Mr Xi his "very, very good friend". Few in Beijing are fooled. Mr Trump and Mr Biden may share a capacity for talking (and talking) in pursuit of a deal. But Mr Xi's grim, security-first worldview leaves little room for foreign friendships, let alone with garrulous Americans.
Chinese disdain combines the political with the personal. In the unmarked villas, private dining rooms and scholarly retreats where-when it suits them-well-connected Chinese sometimes offer opinions to foreigners, Mr Trump is called ignorant, erratic and tiresome, but not without his uses. He is praised for an apparent indifference to ideology. He is complimented for his reluctance to condemn Chinese repression in such places as Xinjiang. People familiar with the thinking of Chinese generals assert, approvingly, that Mr Trump dislikes military adventures abroad.
Chinese leaders initially mistook Mr Trump for a pragmatic tycoon, a type they have met before. Now he is called a narcissist who cares only about his own interests, starting with his re-election. That cynicism informs China's response to the trade war unleashed by Mr Trump, with wary but bipartisan support from members of Congress and some American business lobbies. Plenty of American businessfolk have swallowed qualms about Mr Trump's tactics. They were glad to see him press China over its unfair market rules and industrial policies that promote local champions at the expense of foreign firms. Detecting that Mr Trump was more interested in China's money than in making China change its ways, officials in Beijing agreed on a "phase one" trade deal built around purchases of American commodities. China has kept that deal alive, with state companies buying shiploads of soyabeans and other goods even as the two governments trade angry words about each other's handling of covid-19, among other issues. China has yet to fulfil its threat to name American firms as "unreliable entities" ripe for punitive treatment, even after the Trump administration said it would put sanctions on China for imposing a national-security law on Hong Kong. Mr Trump's supporters would doubtless call China's caution a tribute to their president's tariffhappy toughness. Maybe. But China is also buying itself time. Satisfying Mr Trump has effectively parked America's bipartisan demands for structural reforms. That does not make Chinese elites relaxed, though. They fret that Mr Trump has been "kidnapped" by the truly ideological China hawks who surround him.
As for Mr Biden, in Beijing he is called a member of the former ruling establishment that saw economic interdependence with China as a source of stability, not danger. Mr Biden was a player in Obama-era campaigns to seek China's help in tackling climate change and other global challenges. Yet, in China, there is strikingly little nostalgia for those days. Some grumble that such engagement rested on a mistaken American belief that China would converge politically with the West as it grew richer. Others recall how American politicians bragged that democracies had a creative edge that autocratic China would always lack. That is certainly a favourite Biden line, as in 2013 when he told Chinese students applying for visas at America's embassy in Beijing that "innovation can only occur when you can breathe free." The view in China is that its best scientists and tech firms are busy disproving such boasts, tipping America into a crisis of confidence and anti-China hysteria.
Just as bipartisan opinion in Washington has coalesced around alarm at China's rise, an elite consensus has emerged in the Chinese capital. Especially in this summer of pandemic and street protests, America is called a nation in decline: a rich country too divided, selfish and racist to keep its citizens safe. Chinese elites see Mr Trump as a symptom and an agent of that decline. State media long refrained from direct attacks on Mr Trump. Not now. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, this month reported that Chinese netizens mockingly call him Chuan Jianguo, or "Build-upthe-country Trump". Their joke, that he is a double-agent wrecking America to make China strong, prompts lines like "Comrade Chuan Jianguo, don't blow your cover!" Does such scorn mean that China wants Mr Trump re-elected? There, elites are divided. At root, their debates turn on two questions: is American decline irreversible, and would its acceleration suit China just now?
Two devils, both known
In national-security circles, many see advantages to four more years of turbulence, with Mr Trump weakening democracy at home and repelling allies in Asia and beyond. In contrast, elites focused on the economy fear the premature collapse of a global trading order that has profited China mightily. That prods some to hanker for Mr Biden. Such people think of him as a moderate who might slow economic decoupling, giving China time to diversify and become more self-reliant. Still another camp holds that America's next government, of whichever party, will be filled with officials bent on keeping China down, but that Mr Biden's team will be more competent, and thus more dangerous. Many Biden-sceptics in China note, with alarm, how the Democrat has taken to chiding Mr Trump for being soft on Chinese human-rights abuses. All camps are united by a bleakly defensive mood. Whoever becomes America's next president, China does not expect to be friends.

全文文献: Headnote China is making it easier for its own citizens to adopt Chinese children
Back in 1991, when China passed its first stand-alone adoption law, state-run orphanages routinely gave foundlings the surnames "Dang (meaning Party) or "Guo (meaning Country). These unusual names marked children for life and were meant to. That way foundlings would not forget what they owed the Communist Party. Such names were banned in all orphanages only in 2012.
It is a mark of how China has changed that its first-ever Civil Code, a fat volume of laws covering everything from marriage to property rights, approved on May 28th, revises adoption rules to make it easier for children to be raised in private homes. A big change eliminates the rule that-except in special cases, for instance involving adoptions of disabled children from orphanages-only childless Chinese may adopt. From next year, the childless will be allowed to adopt two children, whereas parents with one biological child may adopt another. Those changes reflect a broader easing of laws that, from 1980 to 2016, restricted most urban families to a single child. A further amendment raises the maximum age for being adopted from 14 to 18.
To be sure, the Civil Code is rooted in a conservative vision of family life. The new rule-book has sparked controversy by imposing a 30-day cooling-off period on many couples seeking to end marriages, to prevent "rash divorces. The code's approach to adoption is no exception. Fang Yan, a lawyer and member of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, backed the clause allowing older teenagers to be adopted. Her not-very-sentimental argument to state media was that parental supervision may prevent "social instability caused by "rebellious youths.
Still, it is revealing that China's rulers, a control-obsessed bunch, are willing to outsource a delicate social problem-the care of abandoned children-to Chinese parents. For three decades officials hid foundlings away in bleak institutions. From the late 1990s onwards, they entrusted thousands of children each year to foreigners not constrained by family-planning laws, most of them Americans. The government's distrust of its own citizens helps explain that approach. Officials knew that informal adoptions were rampant, especially in rural areas, as a way to get rid of unwanted girls, allowing parents to try again for a son and heir.
Social changes explain why the government is more willing to promote domestic adoption, says a doctor who has spent years bringing ill and disabled orphans to Beijing for treatment. On the one hand, as China becomes more prosperous and educated, urban couples are marrying and trying to start families later, only to find that they cannot. As a result, when healthy babies reach orphanages, perhaps abandoned by young unwed mothers, they are adopted "right away . Sometimes, such children may never be told that they were adopted, she adds. Other Chinese are more willing to adopt children with treatable conditions like cleft palates.
On the other hand, says the doctor, there are many fewer abandoned children to adopt. Because even remote villages have access to ultrasound scans, disabled children are more likely to be aborted. More cheerfully, younger Chinese are not as superstitious, and so are less likely to believe that a baby born without an anal opening, for example, must be cursed and fit only for abandonment.
Official statistics bear the doctor out. They show that there were 343,000 children in orphanages in 2018, down from 570,000 in 2012. Registered adoptions peaked 20 years ago, with over 52,000 in 2000. That number fell to just over 15,000 in 2018. Today, just one-eighth of adoptions are by foreigners, who may take only disabled or older children. Yet child welfare remains sensitive, which is why so many in the field decline to speak on the record, from the Beijing doctor to lawyers who handle adoption cases.
Zhuang Ju, a therapist who works with autistic children in Beijing, is an exception. Traditionally, the Chinese have been cautious about formally adopting non-relatives, he explains. But informal versions of the practice have ancient roots. Before China urbanised, many households in the same village might collectively feed, clothe and care for an orphan. That said, to take a boy with no blood ties into a family, giving him that family's surname, was a major commitment, creating an heir with inheritance rights. "In China the first and foremost connection is by blood, he says.
There's more than one way to honour ancestors
Mr Zhuang, who is 49, is not so traditional. Some 14 years ago he and his wife, another therapist, adopted a two-and-a-half year old, Lele, with symptoms of autism. They believed, correctly, that the boy was still young enough to respond to therapy. His mother, a nurse, scanned Lele's medical records and spotted that he had a heart condition, possibly explaining his abandonment in the poor, mountainous province of Qinghai. Then Lele (the name means "happy ) was diagnosed with hepatitis. Undismayed, the Zhuangs, helped by a charity, paid for months of hospital treatment. Then they forked out the extra fees demanded by schools in Beijing to educate someone without a local hukou, or residence permit. Being adopted does not earn provincial children a Beijing hukou.
Mr Zhuang concedes that his father is a bit more conservative. But the old man was mollified by the fact that he has a biological grandson, Lele's older brother (and doting protector, growing up). As for Mr Zhuang's friends, they had already watched him quit the safe government job he earned after graduating from Beijing Normal University, one of China's best, to become a therapist. That career change was such a "completely odd and unreasonable decision that adopting a child barely startled them, he laughs.
Today, Lele is 16 and sometimes helps his father give therapy to autistic children. Not once does Mr Zhuang suggest that he and his wife deserve praise. Instead, he calls adopting his son an opportunity which they could not miss. The Zhuangs may be an uncommonly brave and open-hearted family. The public response to China's new adoption laws will show if they have company.

全文文献: Headnote Great powers gain from being magnanimous. Someone should tell China's diplomats
Late one night this week, Chaguan brewed strong green tea and rewatched the highest-grossing film in Chinese history, "Wolf Warrior 2". This action flick is both preposterous and oddly compelling, offering clues about the sort of China that modern-day patriots yearn to see on screen. That China is formidable. At one point the film's hero, Leng Feng, a retired Chinese commando, uses a home-made crossbow to take on African mercenaries armed with tanks. Then he kills their American boss, a murderous racist who-moments before Leng punches him to death-sneers: "People like you will always be inferior to people like me." The China of the film is self-confident. A crowd-pleasing scene shows warships of the People's Liberation Army steaming towards a wartorn, pandemic-stricken corner of Africa to evacuate Chinese citizens, past American warships fleeing in the opposite direction.
The China of the movie is respected. A climactic scene sees the hero halt a battle by sticking a Chinese flag on his arm and holding it aloft. He then leads a convoy of Chinese and African refugees to safety between two rival armies, as awestruck commanders bellow: "Hold your fire! It's the Chinese!"
Three years after its release, this noisy fantasy is back in the news. In an era of crises, from a global pandemic to an ever sharper contest between China and America, Chinese envoys and state media have gone on the attack. Ambassadors and official mouthpieces have threatened and insulted governments and elected politicians on every continent. Some have promoted conspiracy theories that America's army spread covid-19. In China, this trend is being dubbed "Wolf Warrior diplomacy" by fans and critics alike. Actually, that is an insult to wolf warriors.
It is not hard to find Chinese who cheer the foreign ministry's pugnacious new style. Against that, some members of China's foreign-policy establishment express alarm over this assertiveness, calling it a mistake born of inexperience. That is letting foreign ministry hotheads off too easily. A well-travelled bunch, China's quarrel-picking diplomats know how they sound. They are using aggression as a signal that China has grown strong, and is tired of waiting for the world to show respect and deference. To diplomatic and national-security hawks in Beijing, if some countries have to feel pain in order to understand that China's rise is inevitable and that resistance is futile (and that no help is coming from an America consumed with its own problems), then that pain is itself a useful education. Nor is this approach about to stop. Reporters at the annual meeting of China's legislature, the National People's Congress, asked the foreign minister, Wang Yi, about "Wolf Warrior diplomacy". He did not endorse the term but embraced its spirit. China's diplomats "never pick a fight or bully others, but we have principles and guts", he said. "We will push back against any deliberate insult to resolutely defend our national honour and dignity."
Leng the wolf warrior would only half approve. His China is not merely feared. It is admired because it is generous, in deed and in spirit. In the film, doctors at a Chinese-funded hospital have given their lives to develop a vaccine for a deadly virus. Tasked with rescuing Chinese workers from a remote factory, Leng brings their African wives and colleagues too, even lying that a local boy is his son to sneak him aboard a Chinese ship. The film is strikingly respectful of international law. A lantern-jawed naval commander launches missiles to save the day only when a radio operator shouts news from the Chinese ambassador: "Sir, we have received authorisation from the United Nations!" The film ends with a giant passport filling the screen, and a promise that China will use its strength to protect citizens in danger abroad. Some Chinese audiences so liked this magnanimous, self-confident vision of their country that they sang the national anthem in their cinema seats.
The real-world China of 2020 is not magnanimous. Start with notions of brotherhood with Africa. In April thousands of African traders living in the southern city of Guangzhou were tested for covid and forced into quarantine, regardless of their travel histories. Some Africans were left to sleep on the streets after being evicted by landlords. Others were told by Chinese police to delete socialmedia posts complaining about mistreatment. Rather than apologise, Chinese diplomats and state media went on the offensive, declaring that "so-called discrimination against Africans" never happened and blaming anti-China forces for spreading "fake news".
Cinematic promises to protect Chinese worldwide are not being kept, either. With officials desperate to avoid importing covid cases from America or elsewhere, flights to China remain severely limited, stranding hundreds of thousands of students abroad. Their fate divides netizens on Chinese social media, with many scorning overseas students as spoiled, unpatriotic rich kids.
Over the long run, being obnoxious has costs
This pandemic is that rare event: a crisis that frightens every country on Earth. Alas, the moment finds China in an exhaustingly narcissistic mood. Mr Wang, the foreign minister, declares covid-19 an "all-round test" of China's social system and governance, which China has comprehensively passed. Such swagger offends plenty of foreign governments, especially when they are told to thank and praise China before they are allowed to buy Chinese medical kit. As for rising geopolitical tensions, Chinese officials deny any connection with their assertiveness. Instead they place all blame on established powers sulking about relative decline.
China is not the only large country consumed with its own grievances. America First is a narcissistic slogan, too. But there is at least a bleak candour to President Donald Trump's pitch to the world. Unblushing self-interest is his brand. In contrast Chinese envoys talk of being a responsible, globally minded major power. Then they turn round and stoke nationalism at home, and play the obnoxious bully abroad. Fighting as a lone wolf is dangerous in an action film. It is even riskier as a foreign policy. -

全文文献: Headnote A row about an exam question in Hong Kong signals an assault on educational freedom
At lunchtime on May 14th a chat group for Hong Kong history teachers buzzed with reviews of this year's school leavers' examination. Their tone was upbeat, seeing no surprises in the history paper. That included Question 2(c), which, as in previous years, used extracts of historical documents to prod students to consider both sides of a controversial question. This year's extracts explored how early 20th-century reformers in China looked to Japan as a model of modernisation and indeed attended Japanese colleges in their thousands. Hong Kong pupils study that period rather briefly, spending more time on the years when Japanese nationalism led to violent imperialism, including Japan's brutal occupation of swathes of China in the 1930s and 1940s. The paper asked candidates to weigh the statement: "Japan did more good than harm to China in the period 1900-45". Teachers saw a familiar exercise: an invitation to set out a conventional view-that on balance Japan inflicted terrible suffering-while exploring a few counterarguments. In the chat group someone remarked: "These questions are so similar to previous years." Then the sky fell in.
Over the next two days the question was called unpatriotic by a teachers' union loyal to Hong Kong's ruling establishment (and by extension, to Communist Party leaders in Beijing). It was denounced by officials in mainland China and disowned by Hong Kong's education bureau. As framed, the question risked leading students to a biased conclusion that would "seriously hurt the feelings and dignity of the Chinese people", the bureau said. That language is straight from mainland propaganda manuals, though the bureau is the education ministry of a territory that was supposed to enjoy considerable freedom after it returned to China in 1997, under the slogan "one country, two systems".
Kevin Yeung Yun-hung, Hong Kong's secretary of education, called for the question to be expunged from the exam, unmarked. Japan did only harm to China, Mr Yeung thundered. "There is no room for discussion." China's state news agency, Xinhua, declared that if the question were not struck down, "the rage of all Chinese sons and daughters" would be unquenchable.
These expressions of wrath are ominous enough. But the focus of the establishment's anger is still more alarming. Officials and pro-government politicians in Hong Kong do not deny the authenticity of the texts quoted in Question 2(c). No cries of "fake history" fill the air. Nor is anyone claiming that local students are ignorant of mainland China's suffering under Japanese occupation. Indeed, all evidence points the other way. A study by Edward Vickers of Kyushu University in Japan compared Hong Kong's schoolbooks from before and after the end of British rule. Already, publishers have quietly responded to calls to instil patriotic values, the study found. Post-handover textbooks expanded sections about Japanese militarism and added more photographs of notorious events, such as Japan's massacre of civilians in Nanjing in 1937. Recent editions of a popular textbook dropped an exercise that urged pupils to remember Japan's wartime occupation of Hong Kong, and added an exercise recalling horrors on the mainland.
Instead, the complaint from pro-establishment types is simpler. They say it was harmful for Question 2(c) to ask for nuance at all, when youngsters should be bowing to what Mr Yeung calls "the nation's common understanding of history". Such attacks on a single exam provide cover for a larger assault on Hong Kong's education system, and its emphasis on critical thinking. It is no accident that government loyalists pounced on Question 2(c) just days after the territory's chief executive, Carrie Lam, declared that without stricter regulation, Hong Kong's schools and colleges would resemble a "doorless chicken coop", leaving the young unprotected from foreign infiltrators and false ideas. Ms Lam expressed special disdain for what educators in Hong Kong call "liberal studies", namely secondary-school lessons promoting critical thinking and civic consciousness. The territory's ruling elite blames liberal studies for fuelling student protests last year. That same elite had backed the subject's introduction in 2009, fearing that rote learning was eroding the territory's dynamism.
Learning to obey
One of Ms Lam's predecessors, Leung Chun-ying, announced that a website for pro-government tip-offs now offers rewards for reports about teachers who spread dangerous ideas. A history teacher describes a mood of growing insecurity. "Since teacher training I have been told to promote critical thinking. And now the education secretary tells me that some things cannot be discussed." Bringing the young to heel will be a long and unhappy struggle, she predicts. "It is going to take at least ten years. They will have to indoctrinate them from primary school or kindergarten."
Chaguan spoke this week to four teenagers who took the history paper causing all the fuss. Earnest and shyly twisting their headphone cables during a group Zoom interview, the students made clear that as they walked into their exam they saw exploring all sides of a historical question mostly as a step required to gain full marks. Yet now that others have politicised Question 2(c), they are ready to defend a quest for balance as a matter of principle.
One student said she had been pondering a history major, and possibly a teaching career. But seeing her own teachers self-censoring, she is having second thoughts. A second teenager moved from the mainland eight years ago. Frightened of how Hong Kong's schools are becoming breeding grounds for protesters, her parents sent her younger sister to school on the mainland. A boy recalled rows with his pro-government parents, who dismiss liberal studies as "brainwashing". It would hurt society if the young were less capable of independent thought, he argued. But maybe, he wondered, political leaders want a society that is easier to govern. That is a bitter lesson to draw from a school leavers' exam. Alas, all signs are that Hong Kong's youngsters have more harsh lessons ahead.

全文文献: Headnote Lessons in globalisation, from the small Chinese town that makes half of Japan's coffins
Since ancient times, Chinese poets have revered the purpleflowering paotong as something rare: a tree in which a phoenix will land. Musicians cherish lutes made from its wood. The fastgrowing plant, often used in sandy areas prone to soil erosion, even has a place in the Communist Party's iconography. It is the subject of a rare poem by President Xi Jinping, who wrote of watering a paotong with his tears, shed in memory of a Mao-era official who battled cancer to supervise mass-planting of the tree.
Chaguan, a flintier-hearted sort, would like to propose the paotong (Paulownia elongata to botanists) as a metaphor for something less romantic: a distinctive Chinese business model that rarely makes international headlines, but which has helped to power the country's rise. Governments everywhere are debating the future of globalisation in general, and dependence on China in particular. Politicians and ceos fret about supply chains that cross oceans in search of value, but that now look vulnerable to trade barriers thrown up by pandemics or ideological disputes.
In Washington, China hawks talk of "decoupling", unveiling plans that would see medicines, microchips and other sensitive products made in America again. In Japan the government has earmarked $2bn to help firms move high-value production back home from China. Meanwhile, Chinese officials seem bent on trampling their own country's reputation for reliability. Chinese diplomats, playing the role of nationalist "wolf warriors", have ordered foreign governments to offer vocal thanks if they wish to buy Chinese medical equipment. Chinese ambassadors have threatened trade boycotts against countries that displease the party's leaders in Beijing. On May 12th a Chinese spokesman announced a ban on many beef imports from Australia. The official cited foodsafety reasons, but almost in the same breath condemned Australia's "erroneous words and deeds" in calling for an international probe into the origins of covid-19.
In this turbulent moment, the paotong tree is a timely reminder that globalisation, China-style, does not always involve globespanning supply chains of the sort now causing so much political angst. Since the country embraced capitalism more than 30 years ago, its astonishing growth has also been driven by an intensely localised variety of globalisation, in which a specific export sector is dominated by a single Chinese city or county.
The coffin-makers of Zhuangzhai, a leafy township of 100,000 people in the eastern province of Shandong, are a case in point. Between them, Zhuangzhai's three main manufacturers export 740,000 coffins annually, almost all of them to Japan. With just under 1.4m deaths in Japan last year, that gives one Chinese township something around half the Japanese coffin market.
But when Japanese television journalists visited Zhuangzhai in 2017, they treated its share of the market as cause for larky curiosity rather than alarm. Their calm reflected the obvious synergies between Japan and this corner of Shandong. The largest local firm is Yunlong Woodcarving, which ships 20,000 coffins to Japan each month. Its 56-year-old founder, Li Ruqi, has coffin-making in the blood. His grandfather and father made caskets as well as furniture for locals, defying the superstitious horror that many rural Chinese feel for anything linked to death. In 1995 his firm began supplying a Japanese coffin-maker with panels decorated with phoenixes and lotus flowers. Most were carved from the wood of the paotong, which grows all around Zhuangzhai. Historically, Chinese preferred coffins of heavy cypress or cedar. They thought of paotong wood, which is creamy in colour and light in weight, as fit only for burying the poor. In modern Japan, where cremation in pale-coloured coffins is the norm, paotong is ideal.
Yunlong began making complete coffins for export in 2000, as labour costs in an ageing Japan soared to ten or 20 times those found in Zhuangzhai. Back then Mr Li's Chinese workers were in their 20s, freshly graduated from local schools. In contrast, when Mr Li visited his Japanese customers, their workshops "didn't have a lot of young people". Now China is catching up. With about one in nine citizens over 65, China is at the point on the ageing curve that Japan hit in 1987. Today Mr Li's 600 workers are mostly in their late 30s and 40s. Youngsters prefer service-sector jobs, he sighs.
Cold commercial logic sent Japanese coffin-makers to Zhuangzhai. Shandong offered skilled artisans, easy access to the right trees and a good climate for woodwork-neither dry nor too humid. Japanese clients came with "very high requirements", Mr Li recalls without resentment. Over the years his firm and its customers have innovated, using hollow panels so that a single tree now provides the wood for 20 coffins or more, rather than two or three as was once the case. In one corner, workers are checking a new line of flat-pack coffins. With their pegs and holes and drop-in end panels, they eerily resemble caskets that ikea might make. Mr Li demonstrates the way that two small doors in each coffin lid would open to reveal the face of the deceased. Their hinges must be perfectly silent or risk causing tremendous offence, he explains.
Demographics trumps politics
Mr Li is unfazed by talk of the rich world decoupling from China. Some Japanese clients did try sourcing coffins in Vietnam and Indonesia, he concedes. But they found that workers in South-East Asia lacked "discipline", so returned to Shandong. His corner of China has paotong trees, skilled labour and trusted suppliers. "Price-wise, talent-wise, this place is pretty far ahead," he says.
Demography is a bigger worry. It is not just Zhuangzhai's workers who are ageing. With more than one in four Japanese over 65, coffin sales are brisk. But clients from Japan remind Mr Li that Japan's population is shrinking fast. "They told me I've got about 30 years in this line of business," he says. China's hyper-local version of globalisation may prove surprisingly resilient in the face of decoupling. But some storms will overcome the deepest roots. -

全文文献: Headnote China plans tough measures to crush new covid outbreaks. They may work-but at a high cost
China's most frightening outbreak of covid-19 lurks in Harbin, a north-eastern city known for Russian architecture and a winter festival featuring large castles hewn from river ice. Traced to a Chinese student who flew from America in March, the outbreak has pushed the city of 10m back into semi-lockdown, weeks after a first wave of the virus was defeated in Wuhan, far to the south.
The Chinese authorities are deeply alarmed by imported cases. The country's borders are closed to almost all foreigners and only about 20 international flights land in all of China each day. Domestically, however, travel bans are being lifted, and businesses and schools urged to resume work. Not in Harbin. Travellers reaching the city from abroad must spend 14 days in government-arranged quarantine, then another 14 in isolation at home. School reopenings have been postponed. A single case in a housing compound condemns every resident there to a fortnight's quarantine. When those unfortunate neighbours emerge from isolation they may not leave Harbin. That ban is enforced via smartphone apps that must be shown by all domestic travellers.
The world is familiar by now with China's approach to virus control, combining brute force (breaking transmission chains by preventing Chinese people from meeting others, if needs be for weeks) with high-tech surveillance and contact tracing. The Harbin lockdown is revealing because it was triggered by such a small cluster. At the time of writing, the city has just 63 confirmed cases of covid-19, plus another 17 asymptomatic cases.
Compare Harbin with another chilly, northern city with 63 confirmed cases: Fairbanks, Alaska. Though Alaska has a far higher rate of infections per person than China-Fairbanks is home to just 31,500 people-the state began reopening on April 23rd. Alaska's Republican governor, Mike Dunleavy, told citizens to incorporate the virus into daily life, saying: "There will be deaths, as there have been with car accidents and cancers and strokes." In rich countries, politicians and scientists are weighing the economic and social costs of lockdowns. It is increasingly common to hear calls to shelter the old and infirm while letting healthy folk take their chances. The aim is to restart the economy while keeping the current pace of covid infections-the effective reproduction number, or Rt-below a replacement rate of one-for-one, so that cases decline over time and never overwhelm health systems.
China is taking a different path. Alone among large countries with many land neighbours, it wants an Rt as close to zero as possible, and will endure pain to achieve that. To date, the world shows little interest in debating the wisdom or folly of that strategy. One cause may be suspicion of China's numbers. Western politicians call it naive to believe that China has suffered only 84,000 cases to date, and 4,600 deaths. This when Belgium, a country only a bit more populous than Harbin, has reported 7,200 covid deaths.
True, some official claims are risible, such as a boast in March that the 2m-strong People's Liberation Army had no virus cases. Nor have any senior officials admitted to being infected, which seems odd. Other numbers are surely undercounts. A new paper in the Journal of Medical Virology, by Yong Feng and others, examines serological tests conducted on 1,402 people at a single hospital in Wuhan in April, after the epidemic's peak. Most were locals needing test certificates to return to work. Overall, one-tenth tested positive for covid antibodies. Wuhan's population is 11m. Even allowing for false positives and a sample skewed by the inclusion of almost 400 hospital patients, very large numbers were clearly infected at some point, many without knowing it. Yet a more basic claim-that China is currently free of large, uncontrolled outbreaks-is credible. In Wuhan's worst weeks, smartphone videos of overwhelmed hospitals were seen by millions of social-media users, before censors deleted them. If a city were in such agonies now, it would leak. China has achieved something worth debating.
The Communist Party is a black box. But some incentives that guide its leaders are knowable. For one thing, maintaining order and keeping people safe is the foundation of the social contract between rulers and the masses. That compact wins public support for a fair amount of sacrifice. Should economic woes endure, the party will stoke nationalism, with even more propaganda reports about incompetence and chaos in the democratic West.
For another thing, covid-19's first wave almost broke China's underfunded health system. A paper examining China's virus response, co-authored by Ruoran Li of Harvard University, finds that any city suffering a Wuhan-like outbreak will need 2.6 intensivecare beds per 10,000 adults. Nationally, China has only about 0.3 such beds per 10,000 people (America has ten times as many).
Forget flattening the curve, China wants no curve
Another sobering conclusion is drawn by Qifang Bi and others from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, writing in Lancet Infectious Diseases. They examine how the large, affluent southern city of Shenzhen traced and isolated contacts of early virus cases. The clever sleuthing worked. But questions about asymptomatic cases missed by surveillance "temper any hopes of stopping the covid-19 pandemic" by tracing and isolation alone, they conclude. Put another way, China may feel obliged to keep imposing lockdowns and border controls for a long time, despite the costs. Whether Chinese rulers come to regret that trade-off may depend on whether an effective vaccine is found soon, says Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology at Hong Kong University. "If they can protect people's health and get a vaccine by the end of the year, then China will look extremely smart," he argues.
Should others open up, China will look more and more unusual: a giant economy repeatedly slamming on the brakes to smother even small clusters. If effective vaccines or treatments fail to emerge, that cannot be sustainable for ever. Born out of caution, China's virus exceptionalism is a gigantic gamble. -

全文文献: Headnote The push to raise China's age of consent from 14
Chinese society is locked in a dispiriting argument, worthy of a more callous age. The public is debating whether a 14-year-old girl was a victim of rape by her wealthy guardian-three decades her senior-or a willing partner, trading sex for gifts and attention. Bored and fractious after weeks of quarantine, many have followed the case eagerly. With each twist in the tale, the public mood has swung. In their hundreds of millions, social-media users have condemned the accused man, a successful lawyer, and expressed disgust at police in the coastal city of Yantai, who declined to pursue rape charges despite several complaints by the girl, who also brought them semen- and blood-stained sanitary pads. On April 13th the central government responded, dispatching prosecutors and detectives to probe Yantai's handling of the case. Three employers-an oil company, a large technology firm and a university-severed ties with the lawyer, who is on bail pending a fresh investigation. More recently the public has tut-tutted over seemingly affectionate telephone calls between the teenager and her guardian that caused some to doubt her story. Others have scorned the girl's birth mother for handing her child to a middleaged bachelor offering to be an unofficial foster father.
China's news industry has not covered itself in glory. Spotting a story that stokes readers' indignation, while skirting overtly political themes sure to draw the censors' wrath, outlets have carried prurient interviews with the alleged rapist. He calls himself a man wronged by an ungrateful lover, and shares recorded phone calls from his accuser to back his claims. Quote-seeking reporters have hounded the teenager, now 18, though she has tried to take her own life more than once. They have visited the anonymous girl's hometown, revealing her identity to relatives and neighbours.
Still, reformist lawyers and advocates for children's rights wonder whether some good might emerge from this horrible tale. Notably, they hope that fresh light is being cast on the contradictory tangle of Chinese laws that regulate sexual activity and the young.
At least superficially, China is a conservative country, where rural and small-town elders still chide girls to save themselves for an eligible man. The legal age of marriage in China is high: 20 for women and 22 for men. Before 1980 it was even higher. Towards the end of the Maoist era, when the state sought total control over citizens' bodies and minds, late marriage was used as a tool of population control. Urban couples needed permission from work units to wed. In the 1970s if a couple's combined ages did not add up to 50 they were told to wait, or be denied housing and ration coupons needed to furnish a home. Yet since 1949, when the Communist Party took power, the effective age of sexual consent-as fixed by judicial rulings and then by the law-has been 14. The alleged assaults in Yantai began weeks after the girl reached that age.
Chinese laws do not define a stand-alone age of consent. Instead, the age is derived from rape-related laws. The tradition dates back at least 800 years, when the Southern Song dynasty deemed intercourse with a child under 10 to be statutory rape. Put another way, China's age of consent does not reflect debate about when the young can be trusted to control their own bodies. Instead, it is based on judgments, amended many times over the centuries, about whether men who seek sex with children are always culpable or may have arguments to offer in their defence.
There is nothing new about girls facing harsh and unfair questions about why they let men, including foster fathers, assault them. China's final imperial dynasty, the Qing, required raped women to prove that they had struggled violently throughout their assault, even at the risk of death. If they had ceased resisting at any point, women faced 80 strokes with a heavy cane for consenting to "illicit intercourse". The Qing tolerated the use of adoption as a cover for buying young girls as brides, or for forcing them into prostitution. Even Qing laws on child rape rested on judgments about female lust. A textbook from 1878 cites a commentator opining in tones of prim approval that girls of 12 and under "have no capacity for licentiousness". Not until 2015, after scandals involving officials assaulting under-age girls, did China's legislature revoke a statute from 1979 that defined sex with child prostitutes as a lesser crime than child rape. The law had offered a loophole by allowing men to claim to have paid to assault children.
When the real problem is men with impunity
Guo Jianmei founded Qianqian, a law firm which is representing the victim in the Yantai case. Together with fellow lawyers she has drafted amendments to raise the age of consent, and is seeking legislators willing to help. In a country like China, where feudal morality retains some sway, she asks: "What does a girl at 14 know about sex?" China also needs a debate about coercion and abuses of power, adds Ms Guo. Chinese judges find it easy to decide rape cases involving violent attacks by strangers. But her firm sees too many cases of children sexually abused by authority figures they know well, from schoolteachers to fathers, elder brothers and uncles. The victims struggle to obtain justice.
Another public-interest lawyer, Wang Yongmei, argues for still larger reforms. She would like to see adults barred from sex with anyone under 18. Ms Wang would allow some provision for consenting sex between teenagers, for she has seen cases where angry mothers have unjustly accused their daughter's boyfriend of rape. China needs a child-protection agency and female police trained to support rape victims, she adds.
It takes courage to accuse people in authority of sexual assault. A fledgling #MeToo movement has faced official pressure after young women challenged university professors, television presenters and other powerful men. Ms Wang sees such courage in a new generation of women who refuse to blame themselves for being assaulted. Their bravery is grounds for hope, if the law ever changes to keep up with them. -

全文文献: Headnote Once lionised, a chronicler of Wuhan's virus lockdown faces fury for sharing her story with the West
Clumsy despots use fear and coercion to keep foreign ideas at bay. Smart regimes know that nationalism is a more subtle tool. Bring a society to the right pitch of rage against foreign rivals, and people will scorn outside influences of their own accord. Something like that is happening in China, four months into the outbreak of covid-19. In early February it was easy to find Chinese livid about cover-ups by their government. Now it is not hard to find the opposite: Chinese seething with resentment against Western criticism, and expressing pride as their country carefully reopens while death rates soar in the rest of the world. Propaganda chiefs pound home the lesson to be drawn: because Western governments botched their virus-control work they are looking to demonise and scapegoat China. To be sure, Chinese public opinion is not monolithic, and it is hard to judge the true popularity of nationalism in a country that censors other expressions of anger. But a defensive, intolerant tone now marks too many Chinese discussions of this global pandemic.
Consider the fate of Fang Fang, a writer who spent February and March being lionised by millions of Chinese for publishing online diaries of a rare candour about life under quarantine in Wuhan, her hometown and the city where covid-19 was first detected. Supporters hastened to copy and share each new posting before it was deleted by censors. Fans praised the authenticity of Fang Fang's accounts of life under lockdown, as she shared grim anecdotes sent to her by doctors, mourned friends and neighbours and demanded accountability from officials. Fang Fang-the pen-name of Wang Fang, a 64-year-old author of prizewinning works of bleakly realist fiction-boldly asserted personal claims to speak with authority, as an eyewitness to Wuhan's horrors, and as a survivor of dark chapters in history. A notable clash was sparked by an open letter, purportedly from a 16-year-old boy, who scolded her for airing China's "shameful business". Recalling the Cultural Revolution, when young Maoist zealots denounced, beat and killed their elders, she chided him: "When I was 16, life was much harder than yours," adding that he would one day shake off the "poison" filling his brain. Many of her roughly 4m followers on social media cheered.
Then news broke that Fang Fang's "Quarantine Diaries" would be translated and published in America and Germany this summer. Back home, the shift in opinion was brutal. The social-media hashtag "Fang Fang's Diaries" has received 550m views and 194,000 comments. Recent posts are overwhelmingly hostile. Netizens have been challenging her moral authority, lobbing the revealing insult "Ni bupei!", or "You are not qualified!" Though Fang Fang has pledged to give away her book royalties, she is charged with seeking fame at the expense of the dead-eating "buns made with human blood" as some have put it, borrowing an image from Lu Xun, China's greatest 20th-century literary moralist.
China's tightly censored internet is unusually exhausting just now, filled with the din of performative patriotism, and rows about who has a right to be heard. A self-declared ex-fan of Fang Fang's, claiming to be a surgeon from Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital, fumed that she had handed a sword to China's enemies. The surgeon said history, as written by the Chinese people, would judge her harshly. His post earned more than 118,000 likes. Various conspiracy theories have cast the diarist as a mercenary. Her links to the China Writers Association, a semi-official body, have led to accusations that she is betraying her country while on the public payroll. The Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, cited an unnamed "whistleblower" who alleges that she owns five villas. Fang Fang denies any illicit wealth, and says she will sue her accusers. State media have noted netizens' suspicions that her work was translated so quickly that, in their view, foreigners surely commissioned her to write an anti-China screed. Fang Fang retorts that she began writing with no plans for a book, and learned only later that her work was being translated.
How a clash of civilisations begins
A larger shift in opinion lurks behind this assault on a diarist's credibility. Fang Fang's co-operation with Western publishers sparks rage because the perceived moral standing of the West, starting with President Donald Trump's America, is in free-fall. When a candid Chinese writer is embraced by foreigners, the motives of all involved are assumed to be suspicious.
In China, the most benign interpretation put on Fang Fang's actions is ignorance. Chairman Rabbit, a well-connected, Harvardeducated blogger with 1.5m followers, wrote recently that Fang Fang comes from a generation that naively idealises the West, so fails to see how she is serving the "anti-China industry". He contrasted the diarist with his own generation who, in his telling, have the worldly confidence to compare the West and China objectively.
Chairman Rabbit's real name is Ren Yi. He is the 40-year-old grandson of Ren Zhongyi, a reformer who served as party secretary of Guangdong province in the 1980s. Over coffee in Beijing, Mr Ren (his pen-name comes from childhood pets) calls covid-19 a historic turning-point. Chinese now see America's systemic weaknesses, he declares. "Chinese students are trying to escape the us and the uk to make it back to China. They are confident in this government." He charges that Westerners have embraced Fang Fang because she criticises China's government, and predicts that her voice may have a disproportionate impact on global views of China's response to the virus. That upsets many Chinese "because China feels so alone in the world, and has no voice", he says.
Outsiders may scoff at the idea of swaggering, assertive China as a voiceless underdog. But Chinese public discourse is dominated, currently, by a mix of national pride and resentment of a West that is widely assumed to be acting in bad faith. In their millions netizens are demanding less freedom of speech, if a compatriot's candour helps the West. It is an autocrat's dream.

全文文献: Headnote A Chinese film-maker is reduced to helping individual strangers download his latest documentary
If independent documentary-makers in China are squeezed much harder by the authorities, their plight will soon be a question fit for philosophers. Namely, if a film has no viewers, in what meaningful sense does it exist?
For some years now, the makers of non-fiction films have understood that, without the letter of approval from censors that they call a "dragon seal", their work will reach only a handful of hardy Chinese fans-perhaps via a semi-underground film screening at a bar near a university, or in a small festival sponsored by a foreign diplomatic mission. Losing money is taken for granted.
Even so, documentary enthusiasts were shocked to realise in late March that a respected film-maker was quietly distributing his latest work by sending individual strangers instructions on how to get it from the internet, without paying. These download links arrived as private messages from the director, Jiang Nengjie, to filmlovers who clicked a button marked "Want to watch" when reading about his new project on Douban, a leading review site. Mr Jiang's documentary is called "Miners, the Horsekeeper and Pneumoconiosis". It is about coal workers afflicted with a fatal lung disease. Shot over eight years, the film takes viewers down illegal mine shafts in the central province of Hunan, inside shabby rural clinics and, finally, into a village home where children watch their father fighting to breathe, like a man drowning on dry land. The work has sparked a revealing debate. There have been scattered attacks from nationalists on Weibo, a microblog platform, one of whom demanded Mr Jiang's arrest for his "enraging" refusal to show China's good side. Overall the film has a high rating from Douban's users. A supporter earned 40,000 likes and 2,000 comments with a post on Weibo expressing shock that Mr Jiang was giving work away free. "Shit, independent film-makers have it so rough!" it said. Some users sent Mr Jiang the cash equivalent of a cinema ticket.
This is not dissident art. The documentary offers no political opinions about the Communist Party. It eavesdrops on miners who talk of the authorities with wary cynicism and resignation, rather than love or conspicuous dislike. The state is mostly conspicuous by its absence. To avoid unseen inspectors, miners move at night and dig illegal pits on mountain tops in weather too cold for any official to brave. "Corruption cannot be solved," a villager sighs. "There are still many corrupt officials." Mr Jiang's film has no voice-over. The contrast is striking with state television documentaries featuring bossy, relentless narrators declaiming upbeat slogans. This is film-making that is content to show, not tell.
Reached by telephone, Mr Jiang insists that he has cautious, limited ambitions for his work. Many of those who appear in his new film are his own relatives, for he was born in the mountains of rural Hunan in 1985. China's millions of pneumoconiosis sufferers need more help from health officials, he says. "I want more people to know about them. To see them." A film-maker since 2009, he supports his documentary projects by videoing weddings and commercial events. He did not consider entering this film for a foreign festival, as too much attention can be troublesome. Mr Jiang did not ask censors to approve the work, knowing that they would either say no, or demand a long list of edits. "I'd have to turn my film upside down, and I don't want that."
Some Chinese film-promoters have given up all ambitions, as political controls tighten remorselessly under President Xi Jinping. In January the China International Film Festival, an influential event first staged in the eastern city of Nanjing in 2003, announced it was suspending operations indefinitely. Organisers called it impossible to hold a truly independent film festival, after 20 years of relative openness.
Karin Chien co-founded dGenerate, a film-distribution company, to bring uncensored Chinese works to worldwide audiences. "That was in 2008, and we didn't know then it was a golden age," explains Ms Chien. Technology helped. She watched hundreds of independent films emerge from China as artists, poets and other writers picked up digital video-cameras. She recalls the ingenuity of the Beijing Queer Film Festival which in 2014 staged a screeningon-rails by telling festival-goers to take a specific train, to bring laptops and sit in the same carriage. There, memory sticks were handed out so all could watch the opening film together. Since about 2014, alas, she has seen a steady stream of film-makers emigrate from China. Some others surrender to commercial forces.
Letting the invisible be seen, and the voiceless be heard
The power of documentaries to shake public opinion in modern China has been shown more than once. In 1988 state television broadcast "River Elegy", a six-part call to embrace outside influences and break with stifling traditions. The questions it raised were echoed by the protesters in Tiananmen Square the next year. In 2015 "Under the Dome", a scathing documentary about air pollution, was viewed online hundreds of millions of times and praised by China's new environment minister, before censors swooped. It is hard to imagine either work being screened today.
Independent documentaries offer a sense of immediacy and of bearing witness "on the spot", says Kiki Tianqi Yu, a Chinese filmmaker who is a lecturer in London. Film-makers document history that the government will not, she adds. Those Chinese who are likely to hear about and see non-approved documentaries are a rather privileged bunch: university students, intellectuals, artlovers, urban professionals and the like. Mr Jiang's new film lets them hear a gruff ex-miner lament: "My poor little boy. I can't die. His life will be difficult if I die." Soon after his 50th birthday though, sensing that his end is near, he tells the camera, "I spat out blood yesterday. Damn it." Perhaps only a few thousand people in China will see the film. But just for a moment, a father's pain and fear bridges the gulf that separates urbanites from poor villagers in China, a horribly unequal society. Reason enough for art to exist.

全文文献: Headnote China is not just a real-world power. It is an idea, revealing much about Western hopes and fears
Marco polo is a surprisingly dodgy role model for writers on China. Seven centuries have passed since the Venetian merchant published his account of travels in Asia, including 17 years in the service of Kublai Khan, China's Mongol overlord. Polo's China is a ruthless but efficient dictatorship, a market of staggering promise, a land of great cities and tireless workers. At the same time, he describes a China so isolated that three ingenious Europeans- Polo, his father and uncle-can help the Khan win a military campaign by building him a set of giant catapults. It is an early example of technology transfer via joint venture. Polo's portrait of China, combining wonders, horrors and a dose of Western condescension, set a pattern followed by other authors for 700 years.
In recent years, however, some fine historians have begun to debate whether Polo made his Chinese adventures up, or borrowed his tales from Arab and Persian traders. It is odd that neither Mongol nor Chinese records contain any trace of Polo, though he claims to have governed the city of Yangzhou. It is puzzling that Polo's memoirs never mention tea, chopsticks, calligraphy, footbinding or the Great Wall. For all that, the truly striking thing, perhaps, is how little it matters whether Polo went to China.
Long before foreigners commonly travelled or worked in China-an actual country linked to the world by trade and by two-way flows of emigration and return-outsiders have held strong opinions about "China", an Otherland that is as much an idea as a place on the map. "The Chan's Great Continent", a classic history of Western thought about China by Jonathan Spence, catalogues the many influential writers on China who never set foot there.
Enlightenment philosophers, notably, used China as a symbol for all that is good, or bad, about human society. Leibniz praised China as a land of order, Confucian morality and religious toleration-but mostly as a way to rebuke Christian monarchs stirring up sectarian hatreds in Europe. In contrast, to promote the merits of dividing state power between separate branches of government, Montesquieu damned China as a despotic state ruled by fear, whose peoples "can be made to do nothing without beatings".
On the face of it, imaginary notions of China should not matter much during the covid-19 pandemic, which has left governments wrestling with hard questions about life and death. There is, for instance, nothing very abstract about a propaganda campaign under way inside China to stress that most new infections involve cases imported from abroad. Though almost all of these involve Chinese nationals, curbs on foreigners are tightening. The border has been shut to most of them. On March 27th the government shocked embassies in Beijing by declaring a halt to the issuing of new identity cards for most grades of diplomat. This was apparently in response to the flouting of virus controls by a Western envoy. Embassies, in effect, face a ban on staff rotations until at least mid-May.
Yet listen carefully to Western leaders discussing China in this crisis, and time and again their discussion of Chinese policies is a form of introspection. They are really agonising, aloud, about how they found themselves so dependent on a country like China. On March 29th the Mail on Sunday, a British newspaper, quoted government ministers blaming Chinese secrecy over covid-19 for ruining the world economy. How could Britain not now review Sino-British ties, including deals to let Huawei help build 5G networks, a minister asked. That sounds like an argument about China, but is really a cry of alarm about Britain's sway in a harsh world.
Pushing back against headlines about China delivering medical supplies to Italy and other European countries, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned against becoming "intoxicated" with the boasts of rival powers (meaning, clearly, China). He noted that France and Germany had also sent substantial aid to Italy. Then Mr Macron let slip what really troubles him about this pr contest with China: that it reveals the limits of European solidarity. "I do not want this selfish and divided Europe," he lamented.
Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, is said to be wrestling with how to position her country in an age of sharp competition between two self-interested giants, America and China. Her choices have been narrowed by a loss of faith among Germany's elite in the claim, once touted as "change through trade", that commerce with China will nudge that country towards openness and democracy. China's defiantly hardline turn leaves Germany in need of a foreign policy shorn of wishful thinking. That in turn condemns Germany to debate what sort of country it wants to be.
As for President Donald Trump, he won office, in part, with fiery speeches about China growing rich at Americans' expense. Yet during this pandemic he seems strikingly unmoved by ethical questions about China's conduct. Asked about Chinese propaganda accusing America of infecting China with covid-19, which his own aides have angrily denounced, Mr Trump shrugged. "Hey, every country does it," he told Fox News, adding that his earlier insistence that covid-19 was caused by a "Chinese" virus was "very strong against China".
China as cause and beneficiary of a crisis of confidence
America's allies, along with many Trump administration officials and members of Congress, worry about China posing an unprecedented challenge to the post-1945 global order and the norms that underpin it. All evidence suggests that Mr Trump's concerns are narrower and more domestic. His "China" is a proxy for globalisation, and for the failure of elites to shield American workers from competition. As for the actual autocracy called China, Mr Trump takes its ruthless self-interest for granted, and even praises it.
Western leaders disagree about how to handle China partly because the country has become a larger, more daunting and more assertive competitor. It is also because of a crisis of Western unity. As Marco Polo was the first to demonstrate, foreigners with visions of China are often talking about themselves. -

全文文献: Headnote China's blame-shifting over covid-19 sits uneasily with claims to be a responsible great power
Victory is a perilous moment for a guerrilla army. Over years of civil war, revolutionaries become experts at raids, ambushes and subversion behind enemy lines. Then one day a foe melts away, giving up a great city or miles of precious terrain and setting insurgents a different challenge: how will you govern, now this is yours? In 1949 the peaceful fall of ancient, palace-filled Peiping, as Beijing was then officially known, daunted even Mao Zedong. Comparing his troops to scholars summoned to sit entrance tests for the imperial civil service, he mused: "Today we're heading into the capital to take the big test... All of us have to make the grade."
Today, a new victory is in sight. For decades when a pandemic or other worldwide scourge has struck, the response has been coordinated by rich Western countries led by America, occupying the high ground of global leadership in a mixture of altruism and bossy self-interest. Now, under President Donald Trump, America is abandoning that terrain. Take Chinese propaganda outlets at face value, and China is ready to advance and take the ground.
Some may object that Communist Party chiefs have a nerve to seek praise for their response to covid-19. After all, Chinese officials spent several disastrous weeks silencing doctors and concealing test results, and letting millions leave Wuhan, the city where the illness was first seen. That cover-up will forever colour judgments of what came next: a mass mobilisation of hundreds of millions of Chinese to tame a first wave of infections. Yet bungling by foreign leaders, and above all by Mr Trump, has handed the Chinese government a chance to recover. Plenty of ordinary citizens remain angry about early missteps in Wuhan. But many of the same citizens cheer reports of China's delivery of medical supplies and advice to more than 80 countries, and gasp at news of rising death tolls in Italy, Britain and America.
Small wonder that a cottage industry has sprung up in the West, churning out essays arguing that Mr Trump is creating a vacuum that China is poised to fill, as the covid-19 pandemic reshapes the world order. There is something to this. China's best scientists are sprinting to create a covid-19 vaccine. If they win that race (and good luck to them), brace for a torrent of global commentary comparing this to the Soviet launch of Sputnik, the first satellite. It is sobering to watch foreign leaders, from Serbia's president to Hungary's prime minister and Italy's foreign minister, loudly thanking China for medical supplies and teams of doctors while chiding European neighbours for abandoning them (never mind that some of those supplies were sold by China, not donated).
For all that, it remains unclear whether China wants to occupy newly vacant positions of global leadership-if that involves accepting multilateral rules and norms that might constrain its actions in the future. China seeks thanks and respect for its virus response. It is happy to see covid-19 weaken rivals like America. But it is worth noting what it has and has not achieved during this pandemic. China has long had a genius for befriending countries and leaders who are shunned by mainstream peers. The pro-Chinese leaders of Serbia and Hungary are also autocratic admirers of Russia, whose ties with the European Union are fractious. Recruiting foreign leaders to be "friends of China" is not the same as having an appealing model-a Chinese Way-to offer the world.
During this crisis China has made several moves that pay domestic dividends but make no sense for a country that hopes to win hearts and minds abroad. In particular, official media, backed by Chinese diplomats with Twitter accounts and a taste for nationalist provocation, have promoted offensive, often contradictory conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus. State media have publicised a quote from an Italian scientist, recalling cases of a strange pneumonia circulating before covid-19 was identified in China, and insinuating that this reveals that the virus began in Italy, not China. The scientist has since clarified that he believes that the virus is "without a doubt" from China, fuming about Chinese "propaganda". Too late. A Chinese internet hashtag about covid-19's history in Italy has been viewed almost half a billion times. At the same time Chinese netizens have seized on a rival theory pushed by foreign-ministry provocateurs-though it is unsupported by any evidence-that covid-19 somehow escaped from an American military laboratory and was carried to China by American athletes competing in a military sports tournament in Wuhan. Depressingly, lots of Chinese netizens are unfazed by the flimsiness of these theories, some of which have been obliquely disowned by China's ambassador to America. Convinced that America is a dirty fighter intent on keeping China down, online nationalists have a bleaker goal: get some low blows in first.
When in doubt, blame foreigners
Sowing distrust and division abroad is a risky game for China. Another master of disinformation, Russia, can sell its oil and gas even amid global chaos. As a would-be tech superpower that has profited mightily from globalisation, China has much to lose from a world which cannot agree on basic facts. The nasty side of China's virus diplomacy has political costs, too. European governments may often be appalled by Mr Trump. But in a commentary published on March 23rd the eu's foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, described China's aggressive messaging in a global battle of narratives over covid-19, and pointedly chided powers that seek geopolitical advantage by spinning the "politics of generosity".
China may emerge from this crisis stronger in relative terms, and less willing than ever to be criticised or thwarted. But beware simple predictions about vacuums being filled. The West may lose ground that China prefers not to fill. As Mao understood, an enemy's retreat is a test as well as an opportunity. True global leadership may require China to ditch its love of ambiguity and cynical opportunism, and spell out what it really believes and wants. If that is the test, the hard men who run China may prefer to skip it. -

全文文献: Headnote Chinese teens sitting a life-defining exam may bear the scars of covid-19 for ever
As a teenage schoolgirl, Tang Sisi has mixed feelings about the snowstorm that hit her village in the poor western province of Gansu on March 16th. On the downside, the snow burned out the village's electrical transformer, cutting her access to online classes that have replaced normal lessons since covid-19 closed schools across China weeks ago. On the upside, when the internet dropped just after Chinese class, Sisi's first lesson of the day, she could abandon her usual place of study-a rough wooden chair and desk in an outdoor courtyard, placed to catch the signal from a neighbour's Wi-Fi-and shelter from the storm.
Sisi, whose father is a village official and whose mother is a migrant worker, cannot afford to miss many classes. Like millions of Chinese teenagers she is preparing for an examination for entrance to senior secondary school. It is known as the zhongkao, and sends students down one of two tracks. A vocational track involves three years studying a trade at a technical school. An academic track starts at senior high school and, for the most studious, ends with a four-year degree course at university.
Put bluntly, those who do well at the zhongkao have a shot at becoming doctors, bank managers, government officials or teachers-Sisi's own ambition is to teach English. Teenagers who do badly must either enter the labour market or study for vocational diplomas of varying quality. The zhongkao may not be as famous as the gaokao, the terrifying university entrance exam that has inspired books, documentaries and feature films. But the zhongkao shapes more lives. In one sign of the exam's hold on parental imaginations, Chinese social media erupted in heated debate when Hubei province, seat of the virus outbreak, announced that the children of medical workers would be granted ten bonus points on their zhongkao scores.
The idea that clever, hard-working villagers can make it to the best schools is not just an interesting question of public policy. It is a pillar of China's social contract, with roots in ancient tales of poor students transformed into powerful scholar-officials by brilliance at exams. In modern-day China, a harshly unequal country, education remains an unrivalled ladder of social mobility. Even in a good year, success in the zhongkao is a hard ladder-rung to grasp. As a matter of stated government policy, the test is designed to send roughly half of all students into vocational training, an outcome widely seen-fairly or not-as failure. In 2018 just under 8m teenagers were admitted to academic senior high schools. They represented 58% of all students who completed nine years of compulsory, free education that year. With schools still closed in most of China by covid-19, this is not a good year.
The coronavirus will leave many scars on China. Some of the longest-lasting, but hardest to see, may involve months of schooling missed by vulnerable students, who risk doing worse in the zhongkao than they could have done if face-to-face classes had not been disrupted. In painful contrast, affluent teenagers with good computers, fast internet and private tutors may overperform.
Sisi turned 15 on March 19th and normally attends boarding school in a town an hour from her home. She described her life in an interview conducted over the internet because Chaguan is spending 14 days inside his flat in Beijing, behind a front door bearing a government notice inviting neighbours to monitor his quarantine after a family member returned from abroad.
She has some reasons for hope. Sisi has diligence on her side. Ranked 20th in her class of 52, she reports that "this morning for our English class, only 30 or so students signed in." Her father installed an internet connection this week, allowing her to study indoors from now on. Sisi is under less time-pressure than students a year older than her. She is in the first of two school years that end in zhongkao tests. This June, assuming the exam is not delayed, she is taking two subjects, with the rest to follow in a year.
More alarmingly, however, Sisi finds online classes hard to follow. "Sometimes I come across things I don't know in homework and there's nobody to ask," she worries in a quiet voice. Some teachers move through lessons too fast, she adds. When unable to take notes in time, she takes screenshots on her phone then tries to make sense of the material later.
A veteran middle-school teacher from Xiamen, reached by telephone, fears that virus-imposed distance learning will hit certain students hard. She worries about those without parents at home to police them, and those-mostly boys, she says sadly-going "through a rebellious age" who don't see the point of study.
Quaranteens
Better-off parents can buy help from such services as Fudaojun, an app which offers one-on-one tuition by experienced teachers, at a typical cost of 150 yuan ($21) for 40 minutes. The app has seen orders from zhongkao students jump by 72% since last year. One of its tutors, a chemistry teacher from the southern province of Guangdong, explains how the zhongkao controls access to elite schools with the teachers and resources that help students to reach good universities, and thus prestigious jobs. That makes a bad zhongkao result a grave blow. "If you're already losing at the starting line, the gap to catch up is huge," she says.
Because the epidemic broke out during the spring-festival holidays, easy-going students "still feel they're on winter break, they haven't quite shifted their mindset," worries the chemistry teacher. Nonetheless, one of her tutorial students, a boy with bad school grades, is experiencing a useful culture shock. "Now his mum is home full time, she doesn't allow him to go out and has set very specific times for study and homework. He's already doing much better." That is both a cheering tale and worrying. If good schools promote equal opportunities, closed schools play up accidents of birth. In exam-obsessed China covid-19 is going to break a lot of young dreams. -

全文文献: Headnote A proposal to help a few skilled foreigners settle in China triggers a furore
China's leaders have pulled off a remarkable feat. They have joined the long list of governments humbled by a populist revolt over immigration-though there are hardly any immigrants in China, and political opposition is banned. The revolt's cause is also a surprise: a consultation exercise by the justice ministry, inviting comments on a proposal to make it slightly easier for rich or highly skilled foreigners to become permanent residents. This expands a scheme begun in 2004. On March 7th, after days of online fury, officials took the proposal back for revisions. Soon afterwards censors moved to shut down the debate. By then a related hashtag on Weibo, a Twitter-like service, had been viewed more than 5bn times. A dismaying number of comments betrayed racial and sexual panic, with men vowing to defend Chinese women from immigrants, notably from Africa. Several young women vowed to leap from the Great Wall rather than marry a foreigner.
Some anger is understandable. Foreign permanent residents may have as many children as they wish, and bring them up and educate them in any city in China. Bossy family-planning and residency rules deny Chinese citizens such freedom. Some indignation reflects a trend seen in other countries: a distrust of technocrats who defend migration as an economic necessity. Wang Huiyao heads a think-tank, the Centre for China and Globalisation, which promoted the permanent-residency scheme. For his pains he has been vilified online as a traitor. Mr Wang calls some suggestions helpful, such as requests for clarification of which PhD subjects earn a green card. Defending the scheme, he says: "China has been a giant exporter of talent for the 40 years of reform and opening. Why can't China now seek to import some global talents?"
Some online panic is more difficult to understand. China is hardly poised to become an immigrant melting-pot. In 2016 it issued just 1,576 permanent-residency permits. In the same year America granted permanent residency to over im foreigners- roughly equivalent to China's entire foreign-born population. Unlike American green cards, China's residence permits are not considered a pathway to citizenship. William Rosoff is an American corporate lawyer turned academic. He teaches law at Tsinghua and other universities in Beijing, and secured permanent residency in 2018. Chinese colleagues see his status as a tribute to their homeland, not a new identity, he says. "My Chinese friends and students are all really pleased, not because it makes me Chinese but because it shows that I love China, otherwise why would I want it?"
Yet questions of identity have stoked the most online outrage in recent days. China must not become multicultural, social-media users wrote. Accused of taking foreign nationality, a film actress, Ning Jing, assured fans that she had never swayed "for even half a second" and remained a "child of the Flame Emperor and the Yellow Emperor". That slogan, claiming descent from two mythological founders of China, is telling, for it draws on claims of Chinese racial purity peddled by nationalists for well over a century.
More than 90% of modern Chinese hail from the Han nationality. Han chauvinism helped topple the last imperial dynasty, the Qing, whose emperors were called impure outsiders on account of their Manchurian origins. With the Qing safely gone, nationalists reversed course and claimed the nations making up their new republic-Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Muslim Hui and Tibetan-as branches of one Chinese bloodline. Twentieth-century nationalists embraced Western racial theories and asserted the superiority of "yellow" and "white" races over the "brown" and "black". In Communist times, state-backed scientists have sought proof, whether genetic or archaeological, that China's ethnic groups share a common origin. President Xi Jinping calls China's recorded history unique for its continuous transmission over 3,000 years by yellow-skinned, black-haired "descendants of the dragon".
In much of the West arguments about racial superiority are taboo, and should be, thanks to shared guilt about the horrors of slavery, colonialism, the Holocaust and segregation. That taboo is weaker in China, where schools drum into students that their country is a victim of racist, imperialist bullying, and a benefactor to the developing world. As one netizen wrote during this immigration row, when the Chinese express dislike of Africans that cannot be racism, because "China never oppressed black people."
Blood, soil and flags: a combustible mix
Though China is ageing fast and its working-age population is shrinking, the country does little to help immigrants who have neither a small fortune to invest nor a spare PhD in nuclear physics, and so may not seek a green card. Joseph Matanda, a 43-yearold from Zimbabwe, came to China in 2008 to teach English. Three years later he married Run Qi, a 36-year-old computer-network engineer from the northern province of Inner Mongolia. Mr Matanda lives in China on a spouse's visa that does not allow him to work. He helps bring up his eight-year-old son and new baby, both of whom have Chinese passports. When ordinary Chinese shrink from him on the bus or in a lift, he engages with them in cheerful Mandarin. "I carry myself in such a way that people don't look down on me," he says. He dreams that his sons will grow up to be bilingual bridges between high-tech China and developing Africa: "The world is becoming smaller. I want them to be constructive."
Still, neighbours do not consider their sons Chinese, sighs Ms Run. "In their eyes, they will always be 'of mixed blood'." She has learned to tolerate hearing casual assertions that mixed-race children are clever and good-looking. She cannot abide the usual follow-up, namely: "It's good that they are not too black." The family recently moved to Changping, a bustling outer suburb of Beijing, filled with migrants from other Chinese regions. It should be a fine place to start a new life. But this bicultural couple plan to move to a country where both are allowed to work. Online nationalists may cheer their departure, but it will be China's loss. -

全文文献: Headnote China's propagandists are trapped by their own stirring rhetoric
THE REVIEWS are not yet in, but it is safe to say that "A Battle Against Epidemic: China Combating covid-19 in 2020" has the makings of a bestseller. A project overseen by the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, the forthcoming hardback is billed as a tribute to President Xi Jinping's "outstanding leadership" in the fight against the novel coronavirus. With Mr Xi already dubbed "Commander of the People's War" against covid-19 by official media, it would be a bold party committee or government office that does not order a copy. Yet those eager to reserve one in advance will need patience, because the volume has suddenly vanished from the online catalogues of the People's Publishing House. When the book returns in some guise, as it doubtless will, the contents may have changed quite a bit. For propaganda chiefs need to rethink their rhetoric about covid-19, since they cannot hope to live up to it.
Since January hundreds of millions of Chinese have spent weeks in locked-down villages and towns, forbidden to meet friends and family. Some have had to home-school children. Others are living on savings until their workplaces re-open. Scanning social media for news, many normally apolitical citizens have been angered by reports of official cover-ups and incompetence, or by viral smartphone videos of security forces thuggishly enforcing quarantines. The same citizens have then been shocked to see controversial reports deleted before their eyes by censors.
Anxious to rally a frightened public, Chinese leaders declared all-out war on the devil virus some weeks ago. It will end, they promise, with "a complete win". State and party news outlets have cast doctors and nurses as "white-clad and fearless warriors". Medics killed by the virus have been hailed as battlefield martyrs.
Though China has nothing resembling a free press, some more independent voices can be heard, whether bloggers or a few bigcity, commercially driven news outlets that push the limits of what may be reported. The epidemic has seen notably brave work by Caixin, a business publication whose commercial backers include Tencent, a technology giant, and which is said to have highranking fans, among them (it is rumoured) Wang Qishan, China's vice-president and a former anti-corruption chief. The publication has sent several teams to Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. They reported that officials hushed up news of tests conducted in December that first discovered the new virus and then suppressed evidence that it could jump from human to human. Editorials in Caixin have argued that transparency is the key to winning public trust, because suppressing the truth fuels panic.
Caixin's reports have been repeatedly deleted by censors. For all that, and a bit unexpectedly, its calls to level with the public also earn praise from some in the party press. That may be because greater honesty is the only way out of the trap created by early, hubristic promises of total victory. Back on February 20th, when almost all confirmed cases of covid-19 were inside the country's borders, the China Daily boasted, "Were it not for the unique institutional advantages of the Chinese system, the world might be battling a devastating pandemic." Now the virus has been detected in more than 70 countries, and-in the past few days-travellers have been found returning to China with infections picked up abroad. This virus is going to be around for a long time, perhaps forever. Someone will have to break that to the Chinese public.
Hu Xijin is editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a bombastic tabloid under the People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece. Mr Hu notes that his own paper's reports exposed instances of bungling by Wuhan officials. But he concedes that Caixin's "performance on the investigative front really stood out". Caixin's work gives state media cause for "self-reflection", he adds: the government press "should have played a supervising role" when city, provincial and national health officials made mistakes at the start of the outbreak.
Asked how he thinks Caixin got away with its limit-testing reporting during this crisis, Mr Hu describes a mysterious process by which Chinese media outlets sense the political currents of the day and try to align their work with "what society needs" at that moment, as he puts it. Enter the current at the right time and success can follow, he explains. "If sometimes you miss, the results might be very different."
A provocateur who relishes explaining to Western reporters how wrong they are, Mr Hu is serene about the challenge of admitting that virus outbreaks may continue long after China eases strict quarantine rules. "If we need to change strategy, we can change any time," the editor says, venturing that the Chinese are practical, want to go back to work and live in a country with better virus controls than "high-risk" France, Germany, Italy or South Korea. "They want to be rid of the virus. But if it can't be defeated, we need to accept that too."
When in doubt, lash out
True to nationalistic form, in recent days the Global Times has accused Western nations of failing to learn from China's resolute policies, as the world prepares for a "protracted war" against the virus. Tut-tutting about the cost of health care in America, the tabloid asked, "If a superpower fails to control covid-19 simply because many people cannot afford treatment, then can that country really be great again?"
China's top leaders are more subtle about their blame-sharing, but still at pains to note that virus-control is now a collective, global challenge. Meeting scientists on March 2nd Mr Xi talked of "humanity's battle against diseases" and of the tasks facing all mankind. Such language is not as stirring as books about China single-handedly saving the world. But right now the task is selling something short of total victory to a frightened Chinese public, many of whom distrust official assurances about public health. Blaming the world is a good start.

全文文献: Headnote The covid-19 virus is teaching the world hard lessons about China-only supply chains
Until about the third week of January, only a few pharmaceutical executives, drug-safety inspectors and dogged China hawks cared that a large share of the world's supply of antibiotics depends on a handful of Chinese factories. These include a cluster in Inner Mongolia, a northern province of windswept deserts, grasslands and unlovely industrial towns. Then came the covid-19 outbreak, and quarantine controls that locked down factories, ports and whole cities across China.
Chinese leaders insist that they are well on the way to conquering the virus, allowing them to reopen "leading enterprises and key links with important influence" in global supply chains. A victory over the novel coronavirus will once again demonstrate "the notable advantages of leadership by the Communist Party of China", President Xi Jinping told 170,000 officials by video-conference on February 23rd. But even if all those boasts come true, foreign governments and business bosses will not quickly forget a frightening lesson: for some vital products, they depend on one country.
Where once only a few specialists worried about the market share enjoyed by the industrial chemists of Hohhot or Shijiazhuang, China's dominance of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (api) sector is now the subject of hard questions in Washington's corridors of power and the chancelleries of Europe. Ending the world's dependence on Chinese apis would not be a technical challenge. China has not been dominant for long. America's last penicillin fermenter closed in 2004, as clusters of Chinese factories, many state-owned or subsidised, offered efficiencies that foreign rivals could not match. Rather, change would involve upending well-established political and economic theories, starting with the wisdom of allowing private companies to seek out the best-value goods, with little heed paid to their origin.
There is much speculation about whether covid-19 will accelerate trends in America and other Western countries to decouple from China. In truth, a rush to diversify in certain sectors is more likely, and even such a hedging of bets would build on trends that have been visible for some time.
The us-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional body, held hearings in July 2019 on threats and opportunities created by China's medical industries. The tone quickly veered towards the doomy. A senior Pentagon official, Christopher Priest, declared that "the national-security risks of increased Chinese dominance of the global api market cannot be overstated." He invited the hearing to imagine China interrupting supplies of irreplaceable drugs, such as those that protect troops against anthrax. Another witness, Benjamin Shobert, a health-care strategist at Microsoft, noted that mutual dependency was once seen as a reason to believe that Sino-American relations were stable and safe. But in an age of rising distrust, if those same calculated dependencies were to become a source of fear, then "much of what has supported the modern era of globalisation is no longer valid."
For implacable China hawks like Peter Navarro, who advises President Donald Trump on trade, the covid-19 crisis is a toldyou-so moment. On February 23rd Mr Navarro told Fox Business, a television channel, that America had outsourced "far too much" of its supply chain for essential medicines. "We have got to get it back onshore," he said. Mr Navarro, an economic nationalist and vocal tariff advocate, is little loved by America's trade partners. Yet his talk of nations needing to control certain forms of production finds an echo in rich-world capitals.
Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, says China's dominance in sectors like pharmaceuticals and pesticides is a topic of concern when he visits officials in Berlin, Brussels and elsewhere. It does not help that China has shown itself willing to use trade to bully other countries during political disputes, as when it denied the export of rare earths to Japan in 2012. He does not expect firms to leave China altogether, because it drives global growth in so many sectors. But Mr Wuttke expects the epidemic to intensify European discussions about industrial policy. "The globalisation of putting everything where production is the most efficient, that is over."
James McGregor, a China veteran who heads the Chinese operations of Apeo, an American consultancy, watched businesses putting ever more eggs in the China basket for a decade. Hit by rising labour costs, trade tensions and now the virus, companies have concluded that they need to diversify-though many are struggling to find countries with China's infrastructure and adaptable labour force. Against that, some firms that are in China to sell to China are expanding production there, in part to avoid the uncertainty of tariffs. The most capable high-tech companies see China as "the market of the future" for such promising industries as autonomous vehicles, robotics and the internet of things. They may be rewarded for their faith. "We are going to see the Chinese government be extraordinarily nice to companies once this virus is over," suggests Mr McGregor.
Foreign trade without foreigners
One visible impact of the virus may be to speed changes at the top of firms. Multinationals have increasingly appointed Chinese executives (often Western-educated) to run their China operations. The epidemic may accelerate departures among the foreigners who remain. Air pollution has already driven many away. Some old-timers feel less welcome in a China taking a nationalist, authoritarian turn. Now they are living alone after evacuating their families, or in temporary exile abroad scrambling to find children school places in home countries they barely know. "A lot of my contemporaries don't need much of a push" to leave, says a longtime China hand. Even if covid-19 burns out soon, it has clarified how the world is growing warier of China. Few firms can afford to leave completely. But an emotional decoupling is under way. -

全文文献: Headnote With much of China still on virus lockdown, how are migrant workers surviving without pay?
"FAMILY IS HAPPINESS," reads the motto over the front door of a village house in the north-west of Sichuan province. From the mahjong table beneath a velvet dust-cloth, to the child-sized chair facing a television flanked by pink plastic speakers, all is ready for a family reunion. The home's owners, grandparents in their 50s, have had six weeks to clean and tidy, their longest break in years from lives of toil in Beijing. Alas, the couple did not choose this extended holiday, nor the loss of pay it involves. In common with many of China's 173m long-distance migrant workers, their jobs have been halted by the new coronavirus. Worse, during this subdued lunar new year they have not seen their only child, a 32year-old chef. Curbs on travel have left him stuck in the next-door province of Shaanxi with his wife and eight-year-old son.
In medical terms, covid-19 has largely spared this corner of Sichuan. As The Economist went to press there were 22 confirmed cases and no deaths in the nearest large city, Mianyang, and in the villages that surround it, with their fir trees and duck ponds and fields of yellow rapeseed. Still, quarantine restrictions have shut down bus services. Villages are closed behind checkpoints guarded by local officials and volunteers in masks and red armbands, wielding digital thermometers and disinfectant sprays.
China is a country of half-idled factories, of office towers emptied of white-collar staff, and restaurants without diners. Chaguan this week travelled to Sichuan, 1,700km south-west of Beijing, to meet a few of the blue-collar workers who are suffering the consequences. He found people who are at once more resilient and more vulnerable than their peers in the rich world. Migrants hunkered down in home villages talk of picking free vegetables, or bartering with neighbours. Less happily, meat prices are high. Pork prices have soared since herds were devastated by African swine fever, an animal pandemic that reached China in 2018. None of those who spoke to Chaguan questioned strict government controls, for the virus scares them. Neither they nor their village are named here. These are jumpy times in which Communist Party leaders have demanded that news reports should be filled with "positive energy".
Chaguan chatted with workers on plastic stools outside a threestorey home built in 2008 at a cost of about 120,000 yuan ($17,130). It sits on land owned by a 54-year-old grandfather who works in Beijing as a casual painter and decorator. He is paid 3,000 yuan in a good month. His wife, also 54, cleans an insurance company's offices, earning about two-thirds of that. Their combined earnings make them middle-income workers in China, but they watch every yuan. They rent a room in a shared apartment for a little over 1,000 yuan a month. They make packed lunches and take buses to work. The wife explains that, with underground train tickets starting at three yuan, "If I take the metro I won't have any money left." They have lived in Beijing since 2004 but have barely explored the city, apart from a visit to the Great Wall and another to see Mao Zedong in his mausoleum.
Each morning now, they check for a smartphone message from the cleaning firm that employs the wife, telling her to return to Beijing. As out-of-town arrivals to the capital they will have to spend two weeks in self-isolation, or face legal penalties. Loneliness does not worry them. "Quarantine isn't that different from what we usually do, we just stay put," shrugs the husband. Money is more of a concern, for he will earn nothing while isolated. In a good month the couple save just over 1,000 yuan after rent and living expenses. For years, their savings went towards building their house, which they will leave to their son. Now they regularly send money to help fund their grandson's studies in Mianyang. "We have to. That's how it is in the countryside," says the wife.
Chinese savings rates are high by world standards-even the poor routinely save 20% of their disposable income. In contrast, a study in 2017 by America's Federal Reserve found that 44% of Americans lack the savings to pay an unexpected $400 bill. China's skimpy pensions and health insurance, notably in rural areas, explain much of that thrift. Westerners are helped with lots of costs, says a young man visiting the village from Mianyang. "Chinese people, we're on our own," he laughs. Life under lockdown is cheaper here than usual because social visits are banned. Every three households have been given a ticket, allowing one person to buy supplies for them all from the local market. For now, the grandparents who normally work in Beijing are spending savings. They could survive another half a year, they think, but no more.
Needed but seldom heeded
A sense of powerlessness can hurt as much as dwindling funds. A visit to Mianyang's almost-deserted railway station found a middle-aged couple heading, unhappily, back to Zhejiang province, where infection rates are rather high. They both work in Jiaxing, near Shanghai, at a factory that makes linings for much-needed face-masks, and so have been ordered to return. They do not know if they will be paid for the two-week quarantine that awaits them, which they have heard will be monitored via the gps function on their phones. They do not even know whether their landlord will let them back into the room that they rent from him. Reports abound of migrants being denied entry to residential compounds, as local officials and property managers impose harsh rules, some of their own invention. If they are barred from their home the factory has offered dormitory beds, says the wife. "There is no option. We have to go back," sighs the husband.
In truth, China's economy needs migrant labour just as much as those workers need their pay. Hard, solitary lives explain why the average age of such workers is now over 40. The young often prefer to work nearer home. Though covid-19 would test any country, the epidemic is casting fresh light on a Chinese society divided by cruel inequalities of wealth, political clout and urban versus rural class. This is a crisis with many sorts of victim.

全文文献: Headnote A virus-related tragedy lays bare the costs and trade-offs of life in a Communist-led dictatorship
The death of Li Wenliang has shaken China like an earthquake. He was a young doctor who was reprimanded by Chinese police for alerting colleagues to a new virus that has now killed more than 1,300 people, Dr Li among them (see Obituary). There was nationwide soul-searching when the ophthalmologist told Chinese media, days before his death on February 6th in Wuhan, Hubei province, that silencing truth-tellers can make a country sick. "I think there should be more than one voice in a healthy society," he said.
There is special outrage that this everyman-physician died with the charge of rumour-mongering still on his police file. "What kind of society have we created?" asked Chinese netizens, with a mixture of anger and shame. In the hours after Dr Li's death nearly 2m of them shared or viewed a hashtag meaning "I want freedom of speech", before it was deleted by censors. Open letters and petitions have called on the Communist Party's leaders to honour the constitution's neglected guarantee of free expression, arguing that truth-telling saves lives. "We should learn from Li Wenliang's death," said an academic in Wuhan behind one petition.
Party leaders will not learn to embrace free speech or political pluralism. They know their history and that in Chinese tradition the death of an honest man, wronged by those in power, can be a potent, dangerous event. Many times over the centuries, public gatherings to mourn such people have sparked political crises, including in Communist times. Party chiefs have duly rushed to coopt Dr Li as a hero whose suffering should be blamed on isolated, local wrongdoing. To bolster that idea, officials have been sent from Beijing to look into his case. Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, has stressed in its reporting that Dr Li was a loyal party member. It alleges that calls to honour Dr Li's memory are being whipped up by "anti-China forces" abroad and in Hong Kong.
After a few days in which Xi Jinping, the country's leader, was relatively invisible, the propaganda machine has now cleared front pages for accounts of his virus-control work. Mr Xi made a rare public appearance, visiting hospital and community offices in Beijing. Three days later he reshuffled the leadership of Hubei, the worst-hit area. The state news agency, Xinhua, called him the "commander of the people's war against the epidemic". To some readers, the martial title may sound stirring. Others may fear it leaves little room for scientific debate or scrutiny by outsiders such as journalists, notably those brave Chinese reporters who have done remarkable work in recent weeks in their efforts to cover the virus's spread. In a war instructions from the top are orders.
Censorship is being tightened, ending a brief period of unusual liberty for social-media users. The country's largest internet platforms have been placed under "special supervision" by cyber-regulators, with extra controls on anything resembling citizen journalism. Yet shows of authority cannot stop the public from brooding about Dr Li. As millions of Chinese read and share accounts of his short life and tragic death, they are being forced to devote unusual attention to their social compact with the country's authoritarian rulers.
Sometimes adherence to that compact seems almost painless-for instance last October, when many Chinese expressed deep, unfeigned pride on the 70th anniversary of a People's Republic with shiny mega-cities, high-speed trains and aircraft-carriers that awe the world. Unbidden, many Chinese credit one-party rule with offering efficiency and stability, especially when democratic countries seem mired in dysfunction.
Such confidence is harder now. Dr Li's last weeks on Earth oblige his fellow citizens to confront the costs of a system without free speech, an uncensored press or independent legal system. Many have read the humiliating letter that police in Wuhan made him sign, agreeing that his truth-telling was in fact a lie that "gravely disturbed social order". Not content with forcing the doctor to deny reality, police added school-bully phrases, asking him to write "I can" and "I understand" when asked if he would now calm down and heed the police, or face legal penalties.
Lots of patriotic, law-abiding Chinese have glimpsed for themselves the casual, swaggering sadism of a system without accountability, in which the law is just another instrument for frightening the defenceless. They can see how, when agents of the state fear no external checks and balances, it is rational for them to bury bad news, right up until a crisis becomes too big to hide: a dynamic that builds instability into the way China is run.
Then they came for the Weibo users
Even today's tight censorship is teaching bleak lessons to millions of apolitical folk who normally never see their posts deleted, or notice when news reports vanish after causing too much fuss. Some may be comforted by familiar propaganda about good national leaders let down by bad apples in the provinces. Such tales draw on traditions with deep roots, involving virtuous, faraway emperors and local tyrants. The gains are short-term, however. Each attack on local corruption or bungling stokes public distrust and makes the case for further centralisation. But China is too big to be ruled from its capital, let alone by one man. Even those who think Mr Xi a great commander know that he needs good lieutenants.
None of this presages a revolution. The virus is a hard test for the party, but it has survived worse. A vanishingly small number of Chinese see a viable alternative to the social compact that binds them to their rulers. Still, Dr Li's death has obliged an unusually broad range of citizens to contemplate the unhappy compromises needed merely to survive in a bossy, paranoid dictatorship. After some good years, a fresh crisis has reminded millions of Chinese that their rulers define truth as they see fit. Public anger about Dr Li's fate will fade, just as countries recover from earthquakes. But those who feel the ground shake never forget or trust in its solidity the same way again.

全文文献: Headnote China's Communist rulers see a chance to mobilise the masses behind the party
Asked to craft a metaphor for all that the world admires and fears about modern China, a novelist could hardly improve on the coronavirus hospitals now rising, at fantastic speeds, in disease-stricken cities. Start with admiration. These construction sites are a fine example of decisive Communist Party action. Work had been under way for two days when Chaguan visited the Second People's Hospital in Changde, a city in the central province of Hunan, 400km from the epidemic's suspected birthplace in Wuhan. Half a dozen excavators roared and pawed at the rust-red ground. A road-roller flattened a gravel pad on which, by February 15th, a 200bed fever hospital is due to stand.
Yet if China's resolve impresses outsiders, the dark side of oneparty rule also stands exposed. Changde must prepare for the worst in part because the authorities in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei, Hunan's neighbour, hid the virus's impact for weeks. A desire to earn trust and avoid Wuhan's fate probably explains why city-level propaganda officials in Changde-when this reporter was suddenly handed over to them by jumpy rural officials and police-granted unusual access to the new hospital.
The construction site is overlooked by an ageing hospital block which, at the time of writing, houses 62 confirmed cases. The whole hospital, emptied of ordinary patients and ringed by guards and warning signs, will soon have room for between 370 and 850 patients, depending on how many need strict isolation. It will serve Changde's roughly 6m residents, who are divided between an urban centre and outlying rural counties. Officials say they hope not to need all the extra beds.
China's pop-up hospitals do not merely awe foreigners. They have become a staple of domestic propaganda, with state media pumping out tales of building workers and medics labouring to the point of collapse. For all that, when trying to assess how this crisis may affect the party, it is a mistake to focus narrowly on topdown actions. For the party is also bent on a task that is less familiar to outsiders but central to how China works at times of stress: mobilising the masses, nationwide.
Some techniques hark back to Mao's time. Grassroots party members are busy scolding and reporting neighbours who defy orders to stay indoors and avoid social gatherings. In some regions village loudspeakers, which in the days of collective farms blared out slogans, patriotic songs and injunctions to work harder, have crackled back to life.
Public opinion is hard to gauge in authoritarian China. In Fuqingshan village, perched amid strawberry farms outside Changde, locals describe how they watch for anyone arriving from Hubei and generally "dissuade people from wandering around". Then their party secretary arrives on a moped to ban further interviews, declaring: "There is no infectious disease here." Elsewhere villagers, of their own volition, refer to virus-control as a battle in which all are enlisted: a "people's war", as the party now calls it.
Until January the pole-mounted loudspeakers that loom over Chen Hongxia's home in Guanyin village were mostly quiet, broadcasting only a news bulletin each evening. Now they blare out hours of virus-control information from eight each morning. Ms Chen, 41, concedes that the "very noisy" broadcasts make it hard for her son, who is eight, to study at home. As she speaks, an amplified voice recites rules against hunting or selling wild animals for meat. A cancer patient for two years, wearing padded pink pyjamas on a brief foray outdoors, Ms Chen stands out for not wearing one of the face masks that all Chinese are meant to wear outside, though stocks are running low. "I can't find anywhere to buy a mask. But what should I do? I just stay at home," she explains, as her son scampers up to join her. Asked whether the state or the masses are responsible for beating the coronavirus, she answers: both. "China has a huge population. If you ask me who I should depend on, I think I need to depend on myself," she ventures. At the same time, she adds, the government has "a good understanding of the big picture, which individuals are incapable of".
Passing the buck to the grassroots
There are 99 party members in nearby Luluoping, a village of over 3,000 people. Guo Linlin is one of them. Locals are fearful, she admits, because "the situation is becoming more severe". Her work of reassurance includes watching 14 villagers who returned from jobs in Hubei during the recent lunar new year, who must remain indoors, shun visitors and have their temperatures taken twice a day. This work leans on a "grid management" system which divides the village in two. Further subdivisions are monitored by officials and volunteers, some of them elderly folk in special red-and-gold disease-control armbands. A notice in the village listing new rules imposed by the local county, Taoyuan, concludes: "We invite the masses to supervise implementation."
Mass mobilisation has a dark history in China. Majoritarianism is a temptation in a big and quarrelsome country because of its power to unite people against a suspect minority. Shamefully, local officials have been tolerating prejudice and vigilantism against migrants with identity papers from Hubei, even if they have not been there for months (reports and online videos abound of Wuhan folk being barred from hotels or sealed in their own homes behind front doors blocked with metal poles or chains).
Blaming external foes is a temptation, too. Chinese diplomats and state media have eagerly accused America of unfairly barring travellers from China-though numerous countries have imposed similar restrictions. China's internet is full of conspiracy theories about the cia creating the coronavirus to keep China down. It is tempting to shrug when Chinese officials play such politics. What really counts, surely, is building hospitals and saving lives? But to China's rulers, politics is never play. Every crisis is a chance to strengthen the party's grip. A virus is no exception. -

全文文献: Headnote Xi Jinping wants to be both feared and loved by the Chinese people. The coronavirus may change that
IF CENSORS IN communist-led regimes are good for anything, it is spurring creativity. With a new coronavirus stalking China, netizens have been heaping praise on "Chernobyl", an American-made television drama about the Soviet Union's worst nuclear disaster. Their aim is to sneak discussion of the outbreak onto China's tightly policed internet. In less hectic times censors would swiftly stamp out such impertinence. For the parallels with the reactor explosion in 1986, and the official cover-up that followed, are painful for China's Communist Party bosses, whose system of government was cribbed from Soviet designs. But pointed comparisons keep popping up on China's social media. One urges Chinese viewers to learn from "Chernobyl" that a free flow of information offers more security than aircraft-carriers, Moon landings and other signs of superpower might. Another contrasts a soothing interview granted to state television by the governor of Hubei, the province where the epidemic began, with a speech by the hero of "Chernobyl", a Soviet scientist, about the costs of official lies.
Parallels are likely to continue in the real world. Back in the 1980s, Kremlin leaders scapegoated local officials and engineers, coolly blaming them for the disaster and denying a wider cover-up. In recent days, Chinese state media have dropped heavy hints that the mayor of Wuhan, the industrial city where the virus was first detected, will lose his job. When Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, was appointed to oversee virus-control work, cynics suggested that his role was to take the fall should the outbreak spark a pandemic-in effect, to protect President Xi Jinping.
As it happens, censors should be relieved that Chinese netizens are focusing on the ills of Soviet collective leadership. It would be more dangerous if online critics were to start exploring a historical parallel closer to home, namely the way that in Chinese history natural disasters undermined an emperor's claim to rule. More than one dynasty fell after catastrophes signalled that Heaven had withdrawn its favour. It was not only seen as ineptitude when a ruler was unable to protect his people from floods or famine-or, as in the second century during the Han dynasty, from repeated outbreaks of disease (probably smallpox and measles) that killed perhaps a third of the population. Such bungling showed that the emperor lacked virtue and deserved to be overthrown, people said.
Modern-day Chinese may not believe that a rampaging coronavirus signals divine anger with Mr Xi. Still, the party chief has a great deal at stake in this crisis, precisely because large claims are made about his wisdom, which is now taught in schools and studied by party members as Xi Jinping Thought. Every day, state media credit Mr Xi with personally guiding China to ever-greater prosperity, modernity and global clout. No leader has amassed such individual power since Mao Zedong, or been so lavishly praised. Chinese intellectuals accuse Mr Xi of claiming the mantle of an emperor. They point to Mr Xi's speeches praising traditional Chinese culture, and lauding codes of morality and deference to imperial authority, as handed down by Confucius and other sages.
The result is an awkward hybrid. On the one hand, officials make claims about the efficiency of collective party leadership that would be familiar to any Soviet apparatchik. To them, populist insurgencies sweeping the West are proof that multiparty elections, a free press and other forms of democratic accountability are sources of chaos and dysfunction. As they describe it, China's system is a meritocracy that selects highly competent experts to run the country, with a track record of correcting their own mistakes. Yet at the same time, the party's propagandists lay claim to a very different form of legitimacy, involving the people's love for and trust in one man, Mr Xi. So sweeping is their praise of him that it leaves essentially no room for the idea that Mr Xi could make a serious mistake.
This convoluted claim to legitimacy can be heard in the context of the current coronavirus outbreak, as leaders insist that their system of government is ideally suited to tackling the disease. On January 28th Chinese leaders hosted the head of the World Health Organisation (who), a un body that played an invaluable role in demanding transparency in 2003 after China's initial cover-up of the extent of an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (sars), which led to many avoidable deaths. Wang Yi, the foreign minister, assured the who's boss, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, that China would be more resolute this time thanks to "the strong leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core and the strong advantages of the socialist system", as well as its experience of sars.
Unaccountable, even to Heaven
It is too simplistic to assume that all bad things that happen in China must harm Mr Xi. The virus outbreak could end swiftly, amid worldwide praise for the bravery of China's doctors and nurses, the self-discipline of the public and the resolve of Chinese leaders, albeit after a slow start. If the crisis does not end well, scapegoats will be found, and underlings punished. That alone would not have to shake Mr Xi's authority, which can always be shored up with repression, still greater ideological discipline and nationalist propaganda. But a botched response to the virus would lay bare tensions inherent in the party's hybrid claims to legitimacy.
Mr Xi's China is two things at once. It is a secretive, techno-authoritarian one-party state, ruled by grey men in unaccountable councils and secretive committees. It also claims to be a nationsized family headed by a patriarch of unique wisdom and virtue, in a secular, 21st-century version of the mandate of Heaven. If forced to choose between those competing models, bet on cold, bureaucratic control to win out. For Mr Xi and his team learned their own lesson from the Soviet Union's fall, five years after the Chernobyl disaster. Expressions of public love for Mr Xi, the "People's Leader", are all very well. But keeping power is what counts. -

全文文献: Headnote A year of Euro-summits will reveal much about China's worldview
If judged by words, rather than deeds, China is the world's most powerful supporter of European unity. At a time when populist leaders such as President Donald Trump barely conceal their scorn for the European Union and other multilateral institutions, China talks of deepening and strengthening ties with the eu and other international bodies dear to Europeans.
Their great nation's rise is powered by globalisation, Chinese officials explain. That gives China cause to fear anti-European populism that often overlaps with hostility to trade. As a result, it wants to work with all of Europe on crafting a fairer, more just, multilateral order fit for the 21st century.
There are reasons to be sceptical of such pledges. Start with core principles. China's worldview is built on absolute deference to state sovereignty, chin-jutting nationalism and a belief that one country should not meddle in the internal affairs of another. In contrast, the belief that small and mid-sized countries can gain by pooling some sovereignty is the eu's founding idea. Meddling in members' affairs, to defend inviolable norms, is the union's point.
This year will test China's commitment to Europe in deeds, as well as words. Twice in 2020 the country's leader, President Xi Jinping, will meet European counterparts at summits. The largest will take place in September in Leipzig, co-hosted by Germany and the eu. With Britain out of the club by then, Mr Xi will meet 27 national leaders, alongside the heads of Euro-institutions. European diplomats talk of a meeting of equals: two economic giants discussing such goals as a long-stalled agreement on two-way investments, or action on climate change, and all at a time when America's commitment to international co-operation is in doubt. Even the place, in former East Germany, sends a message, it is said. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to show China that western and ex-communist eu members stand as one.
China has a counter-message. In April it will host a summit of a grouping known as "17+1". Founded in 2012, the club brings together China and 12 eu members-Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia; and five aspiring ones-Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. Recent years have seen growing discontent among eu members of the group. Most have not seen hoped-for Chinese investments in bridges, roads and other infrastructure, and their farm goods and other products still struggle to enter China's markets. Detecting trouble, China upgraded this year's 17+1 summit. It is to be hosted in Beijing by Mr Xi, rather than the prime minister, Li Keqiang, who has presided over the group's meetings to date.
Chaguan asked half a dozen European ambassadors in Beijing whether China was a source of unity or disunity in their continent. The question divided them. One diplomat calls the 17+1 grouping a mostly benign attempt by China to re-establish fraternal links with ex-socialist countries, and no more divisive than the endless bilateral exchanges that bigger countries, like Germany or France, have with China. Still, he concedes, if China sees a chance to get its way by driving wedges between eu members, it will. "The Chinese take the eu as seriously as the eu takes itself. They are taking advantage of the opportunities we give them," he says.
Other envoys relate how China, a bureaucratic superpower, pushes 17+1 members to attend hundreds of sub-meetings on everything from food safety to cultural co-operation, generating blizzards of Chinese-drafted documents. Each must be checked for phrases which either encroach on areas of lawmaking which members cede to the eu, or which advance China's worldview. Recent 17+1 drafts talk about co-operation on the basis of the sovereignty of participating countries, worries a diplomat, seeing a coded Chinese challenge to multilateralism and European values. Such papers are a "sneaky way to test how vigilant we are", he sighs.
China is currently urging 17+1 leaders to express political support for Mr Xi's global plan for Chinese-led infrastructure projects, the Belt and Road Initiative. Some envoys call the bri a useful source of investment, and shrug at pressure to praise it as harmless propaganda. Others are more doubtful, noting how strict eu laws on public procurement or sustainable debt mean that rather few Chinese infrastructure contracts are signed inside the union. That encourages China to sign murkier deals on the eu's periphery.
Some detect serious intent when Chinese officials work tirelessly to fill draft statements with empty-seeming phrases, such as Mr Xi's call to build a "community with a shared future for mankind". To that wary camp, it is no comfort when China says this or that document is non-binding, so hurry up and sign. If countries start routinely using Chinese vocabulary in international forums, when disputes arise China will be the logical arbiter, they say.
Orbiting a red giant
European countries agree on some points. For one, they each crave bilateral favours from China, but fear being left to confront such an assertive giant alone. For a while Chinese officials caused alarm by calling the Leipzig summit a "27+1" meeting, as if Mr Xi were an emperor receiving tributary kingdoms, as one envoy puts it, or a sun around which European planets revolve. Chinese diplomats even questioned whether there would be time for an annual euChina summit, an event involving the eu's top officials but not its members' leaders. China eventually agreed to hold one in late March, and to use it to plan the larger gatherings that follow.
The Europeans also concur that they must keep America in mind when dealing with China. Some diplomats suggest that if China were to agree on an investment treaty with the eu, the price could be an eu promise to keep selling high technology to Chinese firms, no matter what America thinks. But if told to choose between China and America, Europeans' horror would be unanimous. That is not the Euro-unity that China has in mind. ?

全文文献: Headnote America and China talk past each other about the dangers of artificial intelligence
In the depths of the cold war, American and Soviet arms-control negotiators pulled off something remarkable: an agreement so grimly logical that their mutual distrust did not matter. The superpowers pledged to stop building new systems to defend their respective homelands against nuclear missiles. Their Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty rested on a theory of mutual deterrence: the notion that the surest path to nuclear-armed co-existence lay in knowing that war would lead to catastrophe for both sides.
Today the rivalry between America and China is sliding into its own ice age of suspicion. Once again, new and unproved technologies-this time computer systems capable of performing superhuman tasks using machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence (Ai)-threaten to destabilise the global "strategic balance", by seeming to offer ways to launch a knockout blow against a nuclear-armed adversary, without triggering an all-out war.
A report issued in November by America's National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, a body created by Congress and chaired by Eric Schmidt, a former boss of Google, and Robert Work, who was deputy defence secretary from 2014-17, ponders how ai systems may reshape global balances of power, as dramatically as electricity changed warfare and society in the 19th century. Notably, it focuses on the ability of ai to "find the needle in the haystack", by spotting patterns and anomalies in vast pools of data. In a medical setting ai can find tumours that radiologists miss. In a military context, it may one day find the stealthiest nuclear-armed submarines, wherever they lurk. The commission is blunt. Nuclear deterrence could be undermined if ai-equipped systems succeed in tracking and targeting previously invulnerable military assets. That in turn could increase incentives for states, in a crisis, to launch a devastating pre-emptive strike. China's rise as an ai power represents the most complex strategic challenge that America faces, the commission adds, because the two rivals' tech sectors are so entangled by commercial, academic and investment ties.
The good news is that China's national-security establishment is also sobered by Ai's potential. Drawing on the example of armscontrol talks during the cold war, Chinese officials and scholars have begun talking to Americans and Europeans about its dangers. With many government channels of communication suspended by the Trump administration, much of the jaw-jaw involves recently retired Americans meeting serving and former Chinese intelligence and military officers, diplomats and scholars. Chaguan was allowed to attend one such dialogue recently held in Beijing and Shanghai. The Americans were led by Mathew Burrows of the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think-tank. His previous career in the cia included preparing forecasts of global trends for incoming presidents. The Chinese organiser was Xiang Lanxin of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, who also heads the Shanghai-based Centre for One Belt, One Road and Eurasian Security.
Chinese views are not monolithic. Some officials sound gung-ho about Ai as a path to prosperity and development, with few qualms about privacy or lost jobs. Still, other Chinese fret about ai that might put winning a war ahead of global stability, like some game-playing doomsday machine. Chinese officials have studied initiatives such as the "Digital Geneva Convention" drafted by Microsoft, a technology giant. This would require states to forswear cyber-attacks on such critical infrastructure as power grids, hospitals and international financial systems. ai would make it easier to locate and exploit vulnerabilities in these.
The bad news is that agreeing on rules for ai is even harder than wrangling over nuclear arsenals. One obstacle is physical. Warheads or missile defences can be counted by weapons inspectors. In contrast, rival powers cannot safely show off their most potent algorithms, or even describe ai capabilities in a verifiable way.
Other obstacles are philosophical. Seeking areas for co-operation, Chinese participants in the recent dialogue cited counter-terrorism. They suggested, for instance, that Ai's predictive powers might direct American and Chinese agents to shipping containers hiding drugs, or help police track extremists lurking among citizens returned from Syria, Iraq or other trouble-spots. Both sides readily agree on the need for co-operation in the search for smuggled fentanyl. But Western alarm bells quickly sound over China's enthusiasm for algorithms trained to finger potential offenders before they break the law. Westerners worry especially about socalled "black box" algorithms, powerful systems that generate seemingly accurate results but whose reasoning is a mystery even to their designers. When machine learning uses past data to predict future actions, that prompts soul-searching about entrenching prejudice via algorithm. Last year a hearing in America's Congress weighed the impact of facial-recognition technology on civil rights. Yet China shows few such qualms as it rolls out Ai-powered surveillance systems that draw on data sets filled with past misdeeds and anti-social acts, or simple biases. Some use ethnic profiling, most notoriously in the western region of Xinjiang, where Muslim minorities are deemed prone to "mistaken thinking".
Don't trust, can't verify
Repeatedly, Chinese participants in the dialogue downplayed their country's ai prowess. One said that China's military applications were ten or 20 years behind America's. "If I were America, I wouldn't worry," he chuckled. There were many calls for America to remain open to Chinese students and tech firms. "Generally speaking, China wants to learn from the United States, while the us sees China as a rival," a Chinese official complained. To hawks in Washington such talk is a trick: an appeal to keep assisting China's mastery of ai , and to forget the risks. Chinese ai experts might protest that they are damned if they seek co-operation with America, and damned if they do not. That, alas, is the logic of distrust.

全文文献: Headnote To preserve the Yangzi's fish, the authorities are using a blunt technique
For two thousand years the fishermen of China's great rivers have served the literati as symbols of hardships patiently endured. One of the country's best-known poems ponders an old man fishing alone on a boat, protected from the snow by a straw hat. Another describes a fisherman on an island in the Yangzi, indifferent to the vagaries of fate. Political suffering was not forgotten by the poets of old. A fictional fisherman tells a celebrated official, Qu Yuan, who is feeling suicidal because of state corruption, that a sage should adapt to worldly changes. Clear waters can wash an official's hat tassels, he sings mockingly as he rows away. Muddy waters can still serve for washing feet.
This cherished poetic heritage is not enough to save the fishermen of the Yangzi. There have been years of grim data about stocks being wiped out from the country's main rivers. A new report by government scientists has declared one of the Yangzi's rarest species, the giant Chinese paddlefish, functionally extinct. Officials this month unveiled their remarkable solution. By the end of this year all fishing on the Yangzi and its major tributaries will be banned for ten years. This will cast 280,000 registered fishermen out of a job. More than 300 areas were closed on January 1st, shortly after local officials brought in mechanical diggers to smash boats and haul them away.
The need to tackle overfishing is undeniably urgent. As fish have become harder to find, the Yangzi fishing fleet of 110,000 boats, most of them small and family-owned, has grown notorious for using small-mesh nets and even illegal electro-shock devices that kill adult and juvenile fish indiscriminately. When Chaguan this week visited Da Zhong Ba, an island in the upper Yangzi near the riverside city of Chongqing, he found newly redundant fishing families unhappily resigned to their plight.
Their island home is encircled closely by the modern world. Reached by a battered, orange-painted ferry, it is passed by an unending stream of cargo ships. The horns of unseen trains sound from one bank. The low, muddy island is known for market gardens as well as fish. On this weekday a crowd of mostly elderly farmers had taken the ferry to the shore to sell ivory-coloured cauliflowers and great bunches of coriander (or cilantro, as it is often known in America). The air is filled with the herb's fragrance and the sound of splashing, as the islanders wash the bunches in the Yangzi's brown waters before bringing them to be weighed by a merchant from Chongqing, who pays them two yuan (30 cents) a kilo. Yet in a thick, cold winter fog, the outside world also feels strikingly distant, even unreal: a place from which life-changing decisions arrive with little warning. Perhaps 20 families fished on Da Zhong Ba, locals say. They could make over 100,000 yuan a year from catching carp, loach and other fish, even during a season that is limited to four months each year.
News of the outright ban was delivered a few months ago, startling locals who had hoped to fish until 2021. County officials gave one-off compensation of 200,000 yuan to households that surrendered a boat. One ex-fisherman shows a bright red motortricycle bought with some of that cash, in which he plans to haul vegetables along the island's cement paths, too narrow for any car. There is greater gloom in a neighbouring household where three boats supported numerous brothers, cousins and grandchildren. The family owns little land-less than 270 square metres per adult. On a steep slope by their cement-built home, muddy chickens and ducks peck at vegetable scraps in a pen made from an old fishing net, still bearing its floats. "Vegetables are cheap this year," says the 50-year-old wife of one of the brothers, blaming the merchant from Chongqing for miserly prices. "But if we don't sell vegetables to him, how can we sell them retail?" she asks.
Down a slope her husband and other men mournfully construct a gravel road, on a contract organised by village officials. They recall how fish prices rose so high in recent years that a good living could be made even as daily catches fell to between five and ten kilos-down from hauls of 20-30kg that were common three decades ago. Their 74-year-old father concedes that some on the river have resorted to illegal fishing, but also blames pollution and the construction of hydro-electric barrages farther down the Yangzi, including the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams. A son blames those structures for the disappearance of such migratory fish as the Chinese sturgeon, which upstream of the dams no longer breeds in the wild.
Fishermen be damned
Science backs him up. Ivan Jaric of the Czech Academy of Sciences who co-wrote the report about the extinction of the Chinese paddlefish, calls dam-building "the major cause" of the giant fish's loss, even if overfishing "definitely contributed". A Chinese fish expert at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, Miao Weimin, argues that China carefully weighs the benefits of dams, including power generation and flood control, against their environmental costs. He says valuable migratory species like sturgeon can be kept alive by artificial breeding. Chinese officials tout strict new pollution controls and modern fish-farming as additional solutions to rescue the Yangzi, alongside the outright fishing ban.
In vain, some Chinese and foreign scientists have argued for less severe approaches, including the creation of tradable fishing rights that would give fisherfolk an incentive to preserve stocks. Dams and other mega-projects are dear to China's leaders. Laying off 280,000 fishermen seems less risky to officials than debating the benefit of these schemes. (Consider how it is in the West: just 120,000 people are employed catching fish in the European Union, yet they enjoy outsize political clout.) "If your country tells you to stop fishing, you have to stop," says a patriarch on Da Zhong Ba, adding a proverb: "An arm isn't strong enough to fight a thigh." It is not a literary phrase, but ancient poets would understand. ?

全文文献: Headnote Ideology is not what worries the world about China's ruthless ruling party
What does China want from the world? Some things are obvious: natural resources, foreign markets and nifty stuff, from high-end computer chips to top-notch airliners, that China cannot yet make. Then there is China's ambition, at once reasonable and terrifying, to become so strong that no other power will thwart its core demands. China has less obvious wishes, too. A surprisingly pressing one is a demand for foreign powers to recognise the "legitimacy" of its Communist Party. Though it may baffle outsiders, when Chinese grandees meet foreign visitors the question of legitimacy comes up, time and again. The words vary, but their meaning is something like: will America and the self-righteously democratic West ever accept that the party provides the best and most fitting government for China, with a mandate strengthened by the country's rising global stature, economic growth and domestic stability? Chinese diplomats voice the same grievance whenever they hear international criticism. China, they protest, is being singled out for suspicion because it has a different political system, led by a communist party.
If this seems an obscure fight to pick, history teaches the world to beware. A well-connected Chinese scholar who lives and teaches in Europe, Xiang Lanxin, has written a book ascribing centuries of East-West tensions, including several crises in relations, to Westerners who condescendingly dismiss China's rulers, whether imperial or communist, as "oriental despots". He says they have failed to grasp how Chinese leaders must earn their right to rule through deeds and accomplishments, at the risk of overthrow if they are truly tyrannical. Mr Xiang is no apologist for today's party leaders. Though an avowed Chinese patriot, he is scathing about the corruption enabled by one-party rule. He believes that modern-day income inequalities make a nonsense of claims by party bosses to be reviving traditional, Confucian ethics. In a vivid passage, he compares Beijing's political scene to the last days of the Russian tsars, "with charlatans and sycophants running amuck". Still, his book, "The Quest for Legitimacy in Chinese Politics, A New Interpretation", is an invaluable guide to the feelings of hurt and injustice that consume those same ruling classes now.
A political scientist and historian at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Mr Xiang devotes many pages to a crisis three centuries ago. Then the consensus view of China changed among European elites, just as dramatically as it is changing now in Washington and other Western capitals. The cause was an arcane theological dispute known as the "Chinese rites controversy". To simplify, this was an argument about whether Chinese converts could be good Christians if they continued to pay solemn respects to their ancestors and to Confucius, a sage particularly revered by scholars and officials. Mr Xiang praises Jesuit missionaries who travelled to China in the 16th and 17th centuries, painstakingly learning Chinese and studying Confucian classics in a spirit of cultural "accommodation".
Those Jesuit scientist-adventurers reported to Rome that China was a brilliant civilisation whose traditions of ancestor worship and Confucian ethics were not pagan religious rites, but customs compatible with Christian monotheism. With disastrous results for those envoys, hawks back in Europe disagreed. Mr Xiang draws explicit parallels between religious hardliners back in Europe who attacked those Jesuits for being overly tolerant of Chinese traditions, and modern-day critics who chide China for falling short of values that the West calls universal. In 1692 the Kangxi emperor was so impressed by his Jesuit guests that he issued an edict of toleration, blessing the presence of Christian Europeans in his empire. But within half a century Christianity had been banned and most missionaries expelled. The rupture was provoked by papal rulings that ancestor worship and Confucian rites were pagan idolatry. It was an unanswerable charge: the crime of Confuciusrevering Chinese converts was to be un-Christian, as defined by the church in Rome. Mr Xiang argues that those taxing China with being undemocratic are using a similar trick: defining legitimacy in a way that makes it unattainable by rulers who are not Westernstyle democrats.
That does not make Mr Xiang or grumbling Communist Party officials correct, though. They urge the world to judge China's rulers by their achievements, not their political system. But that is exactly what most foreign governments do, to a fault. Even in the immediate aftermath of the murderous suppression of prodemocracy protests in 1989, America's then-president, George H.W. Bush, secretly wrote to assure China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, that his aim was to preserve close ties, adding: "I am respectful of the differences in our two societies and in our two systems." If Western leaders were really unable to abide communists, America and its allies would not be investing in and even helping to arm Vietnam, as a strategic partner in Asia.
Engage with the sinner, hate the sin
Today, it is true, hawks in Washington charge previous American governments with wishing away China's authoritarianism and resistance to change. To quote the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo: "We accommodated and encouraged China's rise for decades, even when that rise was at the expense of American values, Western democracy, security and good common sense." But his boss, President Donald Trump, does not deem China's rulers illegitimate. He says he does not blame them for taking advantage of America's past stupidity and calls President Xi Jinping an "incredible guy".
Chinese demands for respect are in part a ploy, a passive-aggressive bid to browbeat foreign critics into silence. But to meet officials in Beijing is to hear a regime talking itself into a funk about how America and its allies cannot bear to let a system like theirs succeed. That is mostly bogus. The problem is China's actions, not the fact that it has a politburo. But the risks of a rupture are real. ?

全文文献: Headnote An obsession with social control is hindering efforts to turn Beijing into a high-tech hub
TWO CHINAS collided on a summer night in Beijing this year when "Little Zhang", a high-flying young businessman, was summoned for questioning by an elderly neighbour at his housing complex, and asked to prove that he is a legal resident of the city. In the new China where Mr Zhang spends most of his days-a swaggering country rushing to become a high-tech superpower-the 31year-old is a model citizen. He recently secured a job with a prestigious technology company, buoyed by a master's degree from a Western university and a stint with a foreign consultancy. In an older China, a bossy place which issues old men and women with red armbands and tasks them to sit outside apartment blocks, snooping on all who pass, he is an object of suspicion.
Despite Mr Zhang's enviable job, he is legally an outsider in his new home of Haidian, a district in Beijing's north-west where technology firms have sprung up near elite universities. Born in the neighbouring province of Hebei, Mr Zhang belongs to a tribe of white-collar migrants who call themselves, with mock-defiant pride, Beipiao, or Beijing drifters. Its members are hard to spot, but know who they are. They are well-educated and hail from an urban area in another part of China. To build secure lives in the capital they must pull off something hard by changing their hukou, or household registration, to make Beijing their official home, or, failing that, by obtaining an employment-related residency permit. Mr Zhang's interrogation was brief. He showed his national and company identity-cards to the "old granny" questioning him, and insisted that he was "definitely an honest citizen", merely prevented by red tape from obtaining the right documents. Hurry up and get those papers, she commanded. He did not demur, having heard the same demand from local police not long before.
Educated urban-born outsiders like Mr Zhang are better off than working-class migrants from the countryside, many of whom have been summarily expelled from Beijing in recent years. Still, when people like him want to start a family, their children are at the back of the queue for school places in Beijing. They are barred altogether from sitting university entrance examinations in the capital. For Beipiao, to buy a home or even a car in Beijing is to plunge into a briar patch of regulations.
Chinese rulers have long restricted migration between rural and urban areas, and between big cities. As the capital of the People's Republic of China, Beijing has endured 70 years of unusually strict controls. Yet political disciplines are now in tension with another side to the city. Beyond its grey, hulking ministries and Communist Party offices, it is has become an innovation hub, with an unrivalled range of universities, venture-capital funds, technology firms and cultural enterprises. But at private dinners, drinks parties and off-the-record coffees, Chaguan has heard from bosses of multi-billion-dollar firms and the founders of scrappy startups that it is hard to retain middle-ranking staff in Beijing. Many report that employees, especially those with children, want to move to cities with easier hukou rules, cheaper housing and a better quality of life, such as the southern boomtown of Shenzhen or the lakeside city of Hangzhou.
Beijing's trouble retaining talent raises a question that applies to China more generally: namely, are there limits to the flourishing of innovation and creativity in an autocratic, controlling oneparty state? Speak to Beijing drifters, and it is not hard to conclude that the answer is yes. The limits of the current system are felt most sharply by the middle tiers of urban society, they say. The rich need not care about hukou because they can secure foreign passports for their children and send them to private international schools in Beijing or overseas. As for low-income migrant workers, they typically leave their children with grandparents back home in villages and townships. It is the aspirational middle that suffers, interviewees say. There are other ways in which such folk are left out. Risk-taking hipsters are still drawn to Beijing, as well as those who do not care about having children or making much money- the so-called "Buddha-style young" drawn to Beijing's surprisingly irreverent, gritty-yet-arty subculture. The city also attracts conservative-minded graduates willing to work for state-owned firms that pay badly, but offer easy access to hukou and work permits. The losers are those who fall between those extremes: people who want to work for the private sector and build families.
Beijing drifters are masters at hustling around bureaucratic obstacles. A former journalist from central China, now working for a big technology company, describes friends who took low-paid jobs with a party newspaper, then a year's sabbatical to pursue a master's degree overseas-a double-manoeuvre that earned them hukou in Beijing on their return. Another friend worked as a village official in the rural outskirts of Beijing after graduating. A hukou was his reward. The journalist's child, if she has one, will live with her mother-in-law and be educated in the port city of Tianjin, her husband's home town, which has good schools and is a less competitive place than Beijing for aspirants to university.
A place to find good jobs, more than a good life
Politics stops some firms moving. A film producer notes that internet and entertainment companies must stay close to government regulators and censors. But he adds: "If conditions allowed, all companies would consider moving out of Beijing." Other cities have widely discussed limitations. Shenzhen is called a cultural desert. Shanghai is plagued by snobbish cliques. Beijing may be a glorious "hodgepodge" of clever people from all over China, as a financier describes it. Nowhere is as exciting for a first job. Still, every Beijing drifter has friends planning an escape, especially those who lack hukou in the capital. "Beijing is not a good place to fulfil their dreams," explains one citizen of the new, innovative China. The old China had little time for individual dreamers. In Beijing those two worlds of creativity and control increasingly collide. ?

全文文献: Headnote If China wants a baby boom it should stop punishing people who have lots of children
To mark the 70th anniversary in October of the People's Republic of China, a giant parade trundled through Tiananmen Square filled with symbols of what President Xi Jinping, the country's leader, calls the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation". The two most important ones, Chaguan would argue, were a squadron of nuclear-missile launchers and a float showing a model family in their apartment, comprising two parents and two daughters winsomely playing pat-a-cake.
Nearly four years after China scrapped its one-child policy, the harshly enforced system that between 1980 and 2016 limited most urban families to a single child, and many rural folk to two, Communist Party bosses are assiduously promoting two-child families as an ideal. From Liaoning to Hubei, provinces are discussing subsidies and services to support babymaking. It is not working. China's fertility rate is among the world's lowest, and far below what is needed to maintain a stable population. The country is greying fast: the number of working-age people began shrinking in 2012, years earlier than expected. It is a complex problem. But one cause is that officials are too stubborn and controlling to accept that tinkering with quotas is not enough. They should stop setting them at all. Enforcement is now uneven and arbitrary, but some Chinese parents are still being punished for having a third child.
Public opinion is increasingly divided by such coercive methods. The case of Xie Zhengling, a schoolteacher from the southern city of Yunfu, made national headlines last month. According to government documents posted online by supporters, Ms Xie was urged three times by local education officials to "take measures to correct"-ie, terminate-her third pregnancy. Their last attempt came in the month before she gave birth, despite her pleas that her unborn child was "too big" to abort. Ms Xie gave birth in January. Both she and her husband, a policeman, were fired, as is the rule for civil servants who exceed birth quotas. On Weibo, a micro-blogging platform, articles tagged "A policeman was sacked because his wife had a third kid" have been read over 9m times. Some netizens express sympathy, noting that the couple were heeding government calls to have children. Others argue that public servants enjoy privileged access to many services so should expect no pity.
This heated debate is revealing, because it is rare to hear ordinary Chinese challenge the party line that decades of harsh population controls were necessary. Cai Zhiqi, a scientist who runs a chemicals company in the coastal city of Yantai, is a striking case in point. His own life is neatly bookended by the one-child policy. Born in 1979, the year before the policy began, he recalls a cheerful rural upbringing as one of three children. "Though we were poor, the house was full of joy," he says. When his wife, another scientist, fell pregnant with a second daughter in 2010, they resolved to keep her, applying for birth papers without mentioning a first girl born while Mr Cai was studying in America. Alas, in 2012 someone reported him to his employers, the South China University of Technology. In vain his lawyer cited official guidance suggesting that Chinese who studied overseas were allowed two children. Mr Cai was fired as an associate professor for having a second child. Just three weeks later China relaxed the one-child limit as a prelude to eventually scrapping it.
An amiable host, Mr Cai shows Chaguan his laboratories, and points out the schools attended by his young children, amid the skyscrapers and building sites of Yantai's Economic Development Zone. "Like in Harry Potter," he beams, gesturing at a castle-like bilingual academy. He has three children now. In Yantai the fine for a third is about 300,000 yuan ($42,000) per rule-breaking couple, but officials have not sent Mr Cai a bill. "Among my peers now, especially private entrepreneurs, quite a few have three children," he says. "If you want to have more children you pay some fines." Still, he does not question why China's founders imposed birth limits on a poor, agricultural country. Despite losing his own case, he says he understands China's family-planning policy.
A cruel and unnecessary experiment in social control
Many scholars are less forgiving. Wang Feng of the University of California, Irvine, accuses defenders of the one-child policy of confecting a common official claim, namely that the policy "averted" 400m births. In fact, says the professor, that projection is based on sky-high fertility rates from 1970-just before a decade of precipitous fall that preceded the one-child policy. In fact, he says, most of China's decline in fertility rates happened in the 1970s and was caused by such forces as urbanisation and women's education, which led to very similar changes in other Asian nations like Thailand and South Korea that eschewed mandatory limits on births. What can be said is that China's policy produced a lot of one-child families-today the country has about 150m of them- and perhaps tens of millions of abortions and sterilisations, many of them involuntary. Corrupt and brutal family-planning officials demolished the homes of some who resisted. Women had their menstrual cycles recorded on blackboards, for all to see. As birth quotas bit, gender ratios became more skewed by infanticide and sex-selective abortions of girls. China now has 30m fewer women than men. The country has ended up with roughly the population it would have had in any case, but via an exceptionally cruel route.
Still the machine grinds on. While in Yantai, Chaguan dropped in on a population bureau unannounced. A visibly bored official, a Mr Zhao, recalled how once upon a time, an extra birth would prompt a team to race out and "knock on the door immediately to collect fines". His office has not imposed such a penalty in "a few years". Still, he was firm when asked about the case involving the schoolteacher in Yunfu. "According to the regulations, that is how it should be." That bullying mindset is both deeply entrenched and disastrous for China. It is hard to have a national rejuvenation without more babies. ?

全文文献: Headnote The migrant workers who made China an industrial giant face a bleak retirement
Even in a China filled with the shiny and the new, the southern city of Guangzhou stands out. A generation ago it was a smoggy, sweltering sprawl of factories and workshops, a bit embarrassed by its history as a semi-colony of Western powers, who knew it as Canton. Now Guangzhou aspires to be a hub of global commerce. It boasts the 600-metre tall Canton Tower, an opera house designed by Zaha Hadid and high-speed trains that can reach Beijing, 2,300km to the north, in just eight hours. Yet Guangzhou's rise had human costs. The province of Guangdong, of which it is the capital, is a hotbed of worker unrest, with 129 strikes and protests logged this year by China Labour Bulletin (clb), a Hong Kongbased monitor of workers' rights. A growing number involve workers reaching retirement age, who discover that-because they fall through gaps in the welfare safety-net, or because employers skimped on pension contributions-a meagre future awaits.
China's migrant workers, who for 30 years have left inland villages and townships for coastal boomtowns, are growing old. Their average age is now over 40. Nearly a quarter are over 50. More than a tenth of all strikes, sit-ins and protests recorded by clb in 2018 and 2019 involved rows over pensions and social insurance. The latest national survey on living conditions of the urban and rural elderly, published in 2018 on the orders of the Communist Party's Central Committee, describes startling inequalities. About 100m retired Chinese covered by the unified basic urban pension system, to which most full-time urban workers contribute, received average monthly benefits of 2,600 yuan ($369) in 2016. But about 150m retirees had to make do with a state pension scheme open to both urban and rural residents. They received on average 117 yuan ($17) a month, a pittance even in a poor region.
There are 288m migrant workers in China, of whom 173m work far from their home towns. In theory, they should enjoy the same social protections as urban Chinese with permanent residence permits who live in big cities like Guangzhou. They do not. Today's 40- and 50-something Chinese migrants are a "lost generation", argues Mark Frazier of the New School in New York. They fall between the oldest, pioneering migrant workers who were expected to head back to the countryside in retirement to eke out a living from tiny plots of land, and today's 20-something workers, who are less inclined to seek distant factory jobs and are more likely to be covered by social-security protections from a patchwork of new labour laws and insurance schemes. Few see the current system as sustainable, amid gloomy statistics about falling birth rates and the shaky finances of the main urban pension fund: the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicts it will go bust by 2035. Plans are afoot to increase China's retirement age, which is normally 60 for men, 55 for women in white-collar jobs and 50 for female bluecollar workers, though the rules vary by region.
None of those plans will help a group of older workers who spoke to Chaguan recently in Guangdong. The seven women and one man showed hands too damaged by factory work to pour tea without shaking. They shared stories of parental guilt after failing to return home for two or three years at a time, leaving children to be brought up by grandparents. Even during the spring festival, an occasion for family reunions, there was valuable overtime to be earned, said a 50-year-old woman from Hubei province. Besides, returning to the village would have involved long train journeys and buying clothes, shoes and other gifts for many relatives. "We spent 20 spring festivals here," she said wistfully. Unfortunately, before she reached retirement age in September, she learned that she could not draw her full pension in Guangdong because she began to make social-insurance payments after she was 40. If she had local residency she could make back-payments towards the 15 years of contributions needed. As a migrant, her only option was to return to Hubei, where her pension might come to 600 yuan ($85) a month. She compared her fate to an old, bitter saying: "Unharness the donkey from the grindstone, then butcher it."
Another woman had worked at a handbag factory owned by Simone, a South Korean firm, for nearly 20 years. She alleged that her employer had failed to make the correct payments into a state housing-savings fund that serves as a second pension for many. After she complained, she said the firm had denied her overtime and warned other workers to avoid her. Simone denies these allegations. It says it takes employee benefits seriously and "strictly follows" and even exceeds China's labour-law requirements.
A people's republic, for the benefit of bosses
The eight workers had varied problems, but all described a system in which social stability is the authorities' guiding obsession. That preoccupation can offer workers slivers of power if they make just enough trouble, perhaps by staging a respectful sit-in at a government office or party-controlled trade union (China bans independent ones). If enough workers complain, companies will often "budge and pay", one of the workers said. When they go further and organise, for instance through social-media groups, repression follows. In March, during meetings of the national legislature in Beijing, some workers in Guangdong used social media to discuss submitting a petition to the central government. The term "petition" triggered an algorithm. Police dragged workers from dormitory beds and humiliated them with strip searches, Chaguan was told. Other workers were reportedly evicted after landlords were told they were "problematic" by officials.
Many of the hardships described around that table in Guangdong would cost only small sums to resolve. Alas, it would also involve those who wield power deferring to the rights of individual workers. Instead, those workers must navigate a ruthless system in which they must plead and bargain for what they have earned. A remarkable generation of migrants built the new China. They are still paying the costs, in broken hands, backs and hearts. ?

全文文献: Headnote In response to a damning leak, few Chinese officials are blushing
China was this week confronted with documentary evidence that it has built a vast and cruel police state in its far-western region of Xinjiang. In what appears to be an extraordinary leak of official Chinese papers, the New York Times published secret speeches by President Xi Jinping urging that Muslims infected with the "virus" of extremism undergo "a period of painful, interventionary treatment". The leak lays bare the cold-blooded bureaucracy required as China, starting in 2017, seized hundreds of thousands of Muslims, most of them from the Uighur minority, and locked them without trial in re-education camps for even modest acts of piety, from growing long beards to praying outside state-controlled mosques. The paperwork of repression includes a script to be used on youngsters whose parents are behind bars: "Treasure this chance for free education that the party and government has provided to eradicate erroneous thinking."
Chinese officials have offered three contradictory responses. The government of Xinjiang called the report a "complete fabrication" cooked up by anti-China forces in the West who cannot bear to see their region succeed. A spokesman for China's foreign ministry took a more cautious line. Rather than deny the report outright, he called it a "clumsy patchwork" that distorted "so-called internal documents" in order to smear China's successful counterterrorism and de-radicalisation policies. The third response offered by state media and some officials is strikingly different. It skates close to an admission that Xinjiang is indeed under ironfisted rule, and that the world should be glad of it.
Zhao Lijian is a Chinese diplomat and licensed provocateur with his own account on Twitter, a social-media platform banned inside China. Mr Zhao, who was recently brought back to a senior post in Beijing, took to Twitter on November 18th to denounce Western "preaching". Taunting the West for being wrong about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, he declared, "China deserves a big like for showing how to deal effectively with terrorism and extremism in Xinjiang. Toughness and prosperity are a great combination!" That tone was echoed by the Global Times, a tabloid owned by the People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship newspaper. In an editorial paired with a photograph of dancing Uighurs, the tabloid credited "decisive measures" with preventing Xinjiang from becoming another Afghanistan or Chechnya. The Global Times nodded to a strain of thought among nationalist intellectuals and party ideologues, who chafe at the idea that China's 100m ethnic-minority citizens, and notably restive groups such as Uighurs or Tibetans, should enjoy special privileges as the price of peaceful co-existence with the i.3bn-strong Han Chinese majority. They favour promoting a collective national identity.
The Global Times took a bluntly majoritarian line in its editorial, suggesting that when Western elites grumble about Uighurs, they underplay the rights of all Chinese. "The dispute over Xinjiang is a clash between not only two value systems, but also two interest systems. All Chinese people, including people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, hope for peace and prosperity in the region. Measures that help reach this goal are in line with morality and justice," opined the Communist Party tabloid, which has been at the forefront of the more candid, defiant line on Xinjiang.
It may sound counter-intuitive, given the risks that Uighur activists, exiles and Western researchers run to bring information about Xinjiang to the outside world, but honesty may turn out to be harder for the West to handle than outrageous lies. That is because, judging by the Mr Xi seen in the leaked papers, that unapologetic worldview-China is ruthless, and needs to be-is close to his own. The leaked papers include a secret speech from 2014 in which Mr Xi tells senior officials to shrug off international criticism: "Don't be afraid if hostile forces whine, or if hostile forces malign the image of Xinjiang." That was in a time of murderous terrorist attacks by Uighur militants, and in the leaked cache Mr Xi distances himself from predecessors who hoped that economic growth would cure militancy. "In recent years Xinjiang has grown very quickly and the standard of living has consistently risen, but even so ethnic separatism and terrorist violence have still been on the rise," he noted. In the leaked papers Mr Xi puts his faith in allpervasive surveillance, strict ideological training and increased flows of Han Chinese settlers into heavily Uighur regions.
Tyranny of the majority, with Chinese characteristics
Mr Xi's lodestar is the absolute authority of the Communist Party. But he may also be understood as a populist, centralising nationalist. And whether Mr Xi is promoting his "China Dream" of national greatness or demanding tighter controls to "Sinicise" Islam, Christianity and other religions, his ideas resonate with many citizens. Chinese public opinion is not monolithic, and the leaked papers reveal how some Han Chinese officials in Xinjiang resisted the new get-tough regime, even quietly releasing Uighur detainees. But ordinary Chinese live amid a pounding drumbeat of nationalism and constant reminders of an unspecified terrorist threat. There are security checkpoints at every airport, railway station and metro stop in China, complete with giant armoured pots like witches' cauldrons, into which bombs may be popped. There is little evidence that such security theatre is resented. Domestic tourism to Xinjiang has flourished even as police checkpoints and surveillance cameras turned the region into a techno-authoritarian dystopia, with famous Chinese travel bloggers marvelling at how safe the region is. Anti-Muslim paranoia is rampant on the Chinese internet.
Secret brutality by Chinese authorities was hard enough for the world to deal with. Open, unblushing repression is a still greater headache. Challenging horrors in Xinjiang may involve confronting Chinese public opinion, as well as China's rulers. It is unclear whether the world has the stomach for that fight. ?

摘要: The forum was founded to bridge transatlantic differences over China policy after a crisis in 2004, when France enraged America by proposing to lift an EU arms embargo on China imposed after the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Americans and Europeans share many concerns about China's version of state capitalism, which requires foreign firms to buy access to Chinese markets by handing over technology to local rivals and sensitive data to the government, and-as American basketballers just learned-to adopt China's line on Hong Kong, Taiwan and other nationalist shibboleths. Americans and Europeans warned against pouring public funds into domestic firms to match the subsidies that China's companies enjoy.

全文文献: Headnote China is not about to change its illiberal ways. The West must decide what to do about that
THERE WERE moments during a recent gathering of Americans, Chinese and Europeans, invited to Stockholm to discuss China's rise and the new world order, when Chaguan wondered whether anyone would say anything cheerful. At last, halfway through two days of doomy talk about trade wars and some scratchy exchanges about whether Westerners have a right to criticise China's leaders, a Chinese participant sounded an optimistic note. Brexit is an opportunity for China, he enthused-once out of the European Union, Britain will need all the friends it can get.
That was as upbeat as discussions got at the Stockholm China Forum, a semi-annual meeting for politicians, officials, ambassadors, business bosses, scholars and journalists hosted by Sweden's foreign ministry and the German Marshall Fund, a think-tank. The forum was founded to bridge transatlantic differences over China policy after a crisis in 2004, when France enraged America by proposing to lift an EU arms embargo on China imposed after the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Chaguan has joined the meetings since 2008 and has seen them turn testy before, despite endless supplies of good coffee and Swedish cinnamon buns. At a forum in 2018 Americans and Europeans sparred over President Donald Trump's foreign policy. This time was different. A shared fatalism marked panel discussions and offstage conversations. There was a common conviction that China is not about to change its model of authoritarian state capitalism.
A consensus has been building for a while in the West that China is determined to rise on its own disruptive terms. Yet now this gloomy view seems entrenched. It is testing longstanding beliefs about globalisation and the benefits of openness. Interdependence used to be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but now it is clear that it can make our countries vulnerable, a European lamented. Much talk in Stockholm was of Mr Trump's tariff war, and speculation that it might end with China buying its way to a truce, perhaps by purchasing shiploads of soyabeans from farm states vital to Mr Trump's re-election. There was cynicism about what that would mean. Some feared that it would allow China to get away with ignoring American demands for structural changes to China's economy. Americans and Europeans share many concerns about China's version of state capitalism, which requires foreign firms to buy access to Chinese markets by handing over technology to local rivals and sensitive data to the government, and-as American basketballers just learned-to adopt China's line on Hong Kong, Taiwan and other nationalist shibboleths.
Interviewed on the forum's sidelines, a senior Trump administration official insisted that trade negotiators were still focused on making China mend its ways. But the official argued that failure to achieve that would prove America's point about the limits of engagement with China's leadership: "Assuming that China digs its heels in and refuses to do any structural reforms, the entire world will be more aware of China's strategy and behaviour."
Chinese participants insisted that their country was also seeking a negotiated end to the trade conflict, but also that it had grown to depend too much on American markets, technology and even education. "Decoupling is the intention of both countries," said one. Another urged Europeans to remember their countries' ambitions for strategic autonomy and to reflect on their disagreements with America, a country gripped by a "cold-war mindset".
Europeans shrugged off that unsubtle attempt to sow divisions. Still, participants saw differences between America, which dreads China's growing power-including its military and political clout-and Europe, which mostly worries about China's economic impact. Trump officials would like American firms and allies to do less: notably meaning less trade with China in sensitive technologies. Europeans hope to manage relations by doing more. That means at once more trade with China-on November 11th British ministers cheered a decision by a Chinese firm to buy British Steel, an ailing industrial concern-but at the same time more business with other markets, as a form of hedging against China-related risks. Europeans also want to do more to keep important industries alive at home. In January this year the German Federation of Industry warned against "excessive dependence" on the Chinese market. That reflects alarm among corporate chieftains at the political price of doing business in and with China, and at how much that cost might rise. European countries are more willing than before to screen Chinese investments or academic exchanges for national-security risks. That is true even of free-trade champions like Sweden, which used to worry that calls for reciprocity with China were code for protectionism.
To compete with China, do not copy China
Grizzled veterans in Stockholm were realistic about the limits of Western unity and bravery in the face of China. At least the West should avoid self-harming policies, they agreed. Americans and Europeans warned against pouring public funds into domestic firms to match the subsidies that China's companies enjoy. China would win that race, they said. It would be better to enforce rules against market-distorting subsidies for any firms, foreign or domestic. If Western governments must choose sectors to favour, they should help by investing in research, education or infrastructure, and by welcoming skilled immigrants.
Long ago at these gatherings Western speakers urged China, too, to be smart. They would craft clever ways to explain why liberal economic and even political reforms would be in China's own interests. Not this time. A reform-minded Chinese speaker said his country was "too big, too old and too conservative" to adopt a different model. Some of the Westerners dared to suggest that autocratic statism might harm China in the long term. Chinese counterparts scolded them for "cultural arrogance".

全文文献: Headnote Capitalism breeds new respect for regional dialects
GROWING UP in the Dabie mountains of western Anhui at the height of the Cultural Revolution, Yu Yan learned from a young age that many innocent acts could get her into trouble, starting with using her mother tongue-a dialect of the Chinese language known as Lower Yangzi Mandarin-in her school playground. Fully 70m Chinese speak some form of Lower Yangzi Mandarin, a language that is unintelligible to Chinese raised in northern cities such as Beijing. But back in those dark days of thought control, a little girl chattering in mountain dialect risked a scolding-at least-for not using putonghua, the state-standardised form of Mandarin that was the language of Maoist orthodoxy.
Nearly half a century later, officials still promote putonghua as a tool of national unity. Yet the value of local dialects is on the rise, as Ms Yu, who now manages an old people's home in the coastal province of Zhejiang, knows well.
Her private facility, called Riyuexing, is perched in a steep, terraced valley above the county town of Wencheng. Its 160 residents are mostly men in their late 70s or older. Rural families seem keener on keeping grandmothers at home, Ms Yu observes delicately. Old men have bad tempers, do not listen and can smell bad, she says. Only about a third of her charges speak putonghua. That obliges Ms Yu to hunt for care workers who can, between them, speak the four or five local dialects heard in the home's plain but airy corridors. Interrupting an intense game of mahjong, Chaguan asks an 89-year-old resident whether it is possible to make friends with others at the home who speak different dialects. "You can't," he growls, turning back to the tiles.
There are practical reasons to hire dialect-speakers, notably when caring for residents with dementia, who need constant guidance in a world turned foggy and frightening. There are commercial reasons, too. The home opened in 2015, and though fees are low, at about 2,000 yuan ($285) a month, rural families break with tradition by placing the elderly in care. They need to know that the residents will be treated kindly and that being put into the home is not akin to a death sentence, as Ms Yu puts it.
An official study in 2013 estimated that 400m Chinese, or almost a third of the population, are not proficient in putonghua. Most of them live in smaller cities, rural areas and regions with many ethnic minorities. The education ministry has pledged more effort to teach the official tongue. But in tucked-away corners of China, like Wencheng, where dialects change from valley to valley, linguistic diversity is increasingly seen as a business opportunity.
An ageing society and growing spending power in China's backwaters are bringing old people's homes to unfamiliar places. To prosper, this growing industry needs to talk in languages that its newest customers understand. More generally, China is evolving from a manufacturing and export behemoth into an economy sustained more by domestic consumption. Businesses previously focused on large urban centres and coastal boomtowns. Now they are looking for growth in smaller, unflashy cities where lower housing costs, higher birth rates and more migrant-friendly residency laws could see annual household consumption triple between 2017 and 2030, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank.
Earlier this year Alibaba, a technology firm, announced a project to teach its Tmall Genie smart speakers to recognise dialects, starting with Sichuanese, the largest regional tongue, before moving on to Cantonese and eventually most others. Consumers in smaller cities, especially older ones, are not always "savvy with keyboards", says an Alibaba representative, and are more likely to treat smart speakers as a companion, calling up traditional operas or health information, or audio-books for grandchildren left in their charge. Younger consumers may be more comfortable in putonghua, but that does not mean that dialects will disappear, because speaking a dialect feels like "home", she adds.
The central government remains capable of cruel chauvinism towards minorities deemed a threat to national unity. Uighurs, a Muslim ethnic group in the western region of Xinjiang, have seen their language all but banned in schools and vanish from bookshops, with long spells in prison or re-education camps for those who resist. The Tibetan language is under similar pressure. But in places like Wencheng, in the Chinese heartlands, the same forces that drive commercial services to use dialects are also pushing local officials to do the same. The office in Wencheng that issues identity cards and other official paperwork recently opened a dialect-speaking service desk. The same office offers video conferencing to the legions of Wencheng natives who live in northern Italy, many as workers in clothing factories. The government wants to maintain close links with overseas Chinese, so it is pragmatic about the dialects that are commonly used in the diaspora. Language is a complex business in Wencheng, a dusty town filled with strikingly fine espresso bars, selling Italian coffee to returnees who know their Lavazza from their Illy. Luo Jianyang, a café-owner, explains how she brought her children home from Italy in 2012 because she worried about their poor putonghua. She now frets that she should teach them Wencheng dialect, too.
Can you hear me now?
Western politicians once confidently predicted that growing Chinese prosperity and the emergence of a middle class would trigger calls for political liberalisation in China. That proved overly optimistic. The country's rulers have chosen a very different, authoritarian path, insisting that only absolute control by the Communist Party can promote continued development. But in spheres outside politics, companies big and small are giving more thought to how to make individuals feel heeded and respected. Even in unfashionable corners of China, millions of consumers have a voice, and- unlike in the era of central planning-that voice does not always have to speak standard Mandarin.

全文文献: Headnote China needs global help to grow, so its rulers may have to rethink their obsession with control
On past form, boasts of China's openness to the world will come thick and fast when President Xi Jinping addresses the Second China International Import Expo in Shanghai on November 5th. Speaking at the inaugural edition of that trade fair last year, Mr Xi cast China as a champion of free trade and mutually beneficial co-operation. Openness brings progress while seclusion leads to backwardness, he declared. Slipping into fluent Globalese, the blandly uplifting argot used at gatherings of world leaders, billionaires and ceos, Mr Xi beamed that it was natural to share the fruits of innovation "in our interconnected global village".
China's leader has every reason to offer warm words at the upcoming event. Even as his country grows richer and more powerful, it is dependent on the world in ways that it cannot control. China has ambitions to become a standard-setting technology superpower. For all its talk of self-reliance, it needs foreign knowhow to get there. In the short term, China is anxious for a truce in its trade war with America. It wants to show other countries that it is a team player, unlike that rule-breaking bully in Washington. Further ahead its economy will need growing room. China is running out of useful places to build shiny airports and high-speed railway lines at home, and wants its own global brands to vie with Boeing or Apple. That will require new markets overseas.
Yet before he steps to his lectern in Shanghai, Mr Xi must preside over a different meeting, a four-day session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party ending on October 31st. Such conclaves of nearly 400 top officials are typically held every year or so at a high-security hotel run by the People's Liberation Army in western Beijing. The working language is not Globalese. Communiques that emerge from these secret meetings are written in unlovely party jargon. State media announced that the plenum would consider "important issues concerning how to uphold and improve the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and make progress in modernising the country's governance system and capacity". That sounds dull, but the meaning is serious. Even tighter controls are coming. Clues were dropped this month by an influential party journal, Qiushi, in extracts it published of a previously secret speech in which Mr Xi pondered lessons from history. "Whenever great powers have collapsed or decayed, a common cause has been the loss of central authority," he concluded.
Propaganda organs pretend there is no contradiction between these two personas-a smiling President Xi talking to foreigners about global villages, and Xi the general secretary grimly demanding party discipline and vigilance in the face of hostile external forces and internal threats. On the plenum's opening day, Xinhua, a state news agency, asserted that the world had never seen a governing system with such advantages, combining an "economic development miracle" with a "miracle of political stability".
At home, it is fair to concede, many Chinese accept the social contract implicit in that Xinhua commentary, that personal freedoms should be traded for prosperity and order. To outsiders, however, China's two self-declared miracles are increasingly in tension. For a long time, many foreign admirers of China treated party rule as a bit of a joke. This place has only one ideology, they chuckled: making money. Unfortunately for such people, even as China loosens some rules on market access or foreign investment, the party not only refuses to fade away but is becoming ever more visible and intrusive. Very possibly the guiding ideology is a desire for absolute power, rather than Marxist idealism. In a secretive autocracy, it is impossible to know Mr Xi's real beliefs. Similarly, outsiders can only guess at the meaning of fawning adulation heaped on him before the plenum, such as by a regional party committee which said officials should, deep in their hearts, "strengthen their trust and love in General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core of the party, the people's leader and commander-in-chief of the army". This may reflect Mr Xi's mightiness, or his weakness and insecurity. But to judge by his actions, Mr Xi has asserted the party's total authority over China's system of state capitalism, from law courts to private firms and lumbering state enterprises. And one powergrab often prompts another. When modestly paid bureaucrats have sway over billion-dollar assets at the same time that feistier newspapers are silenced and independent lawyers locked up, it is no surprise that the party has to launch anti-corruption campaigns so fierce that some officials fear taking decisions at all.
Running a 21st-century economy with ideas from the 1950s
The very complexity of modern Chinese society, with its growing mobility and personal freedoms for those who stay within partydefined boundaries, seems to convince China's leaders that they must tighten and retighten their grip. Increasingly that involves high-technology systems of control, from algorithms that censor social media, to facial-recognition systems that stop errant citizens from catching high-speed trains. To officials at home, technoauthoritarianism is a saviour. With big data to crunch and nowhere for miscreants to hide, perhaps top-down rule can at last be made to work. Abroad, the trade-offs look different. Not long ago, Silicon Valley investors might have swooned over a mobile-payment system built around Chinese facial-recognition technology, for instance. Now, shrewd fund managers-and young potential consumers in the West-might ask whether the same cameras are used to repress Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.
The authoritarian turn that China is taking, in the name of saving one-party rule from itself, is hard to square with a quest for globally driven growth. Already foreign bosses privately admit to wondering, as never before, what it means when a Chinese business partner is a party member. Mr Xi seems to want a China that is open to foreign investors and inventions but closed to dangerously foreign (meaning liberal, Western) ideas. Communists are fascinated by contradictions. This one may prove hard to resolve. ?

摘要: China's grandest music academy this month unveiled a full-length, Western-style opera about Zhou Enlai. The puzzle is that it took this long. Opera is arguably the only art form big enough to capture the contradictions of this brilliant moral failure of a man, Mao Zedong's prime minister for over a quarter century. Those who served alongside Zhou viewed him with mixed emotions. Veterans of China's civil war remembered how he coldly ordered the killing not just of traitors, but also of their extended families. Alas, Zhou Enlai the opera, which premiered on October 15th in the former Red Army base of Yan'an, fails to capture the sweep of that life.

全文文献: Headnote Mao's chief aide was a hero to some Chinese. The party prefers to forget why
CHINA'S GRANDEST music academy this month unveiled a fulllength, Western-style opera about Zhou Enlai. The puzzle is that it took this long. Opera is arguably the only art form big enough to capture the contradictions of this brilliant moral failure of a man, Mao Zedong's prime minister for over a quarter century.
When Zhou died in 1976 he was beloved by Chinese who did not know him well. Vast throngs of Beijingers filled Tiananmen Square in the spring of that year to mourn him, risking arrests and police beatings to remember a leader they credited with moderating the worst excesses of that fanatical era. Their lamentations were also a coded attack on ultra-leftist zealots who were circling the ailing Mao, now that Zhou was gone. Some praise was merited. Papers published after his death show Zhou reporting rural starvation to the chairman-though without identifying the famine's cause, namely Mao's own policies. Documents show Zhou working to rehabilitate purged scientists and officials, if only because China's economy needed competent managers. To this day, locals across China will point to a beloved temple and thank the former prime minister, often without hard evidence, for issuing orders that shielded the site from Red Guards. China's music world owes Zhou a debt for encouraging propaganda works of some artistic merit, such as the revolutionary opera "The East is Red", and for protecting performers from vicious cultural commissars.
Those who served alongside Zhou viewed him with mixed emotions. Veterans of China's civil war remembered how he coldly ordered the killing not just of traitors, but also of their extended families. After the founding of the People's Republic, colleagues watched this loyal courtier pay a high price to stay by Mao's side, betraying lifelong comrades when called upon to denounce them, and his own conscience when offering grovelling self-criticisms. Defenders argue that he did what he could, nudging Mao's instincts in more constructive directions without confronting him.
Alas, "Zhou Enlai" the opera, which premiered on October 15th in the former Red Army base of Yan'an, fails to capture the sweep of that life. This shrill, empty work-which Chaguan watched on October 20th at a gala performance in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province-says more about the state of public art in today's China. Composed by a professor at the Central Conservatory of Music and sponsored by Jiangsu, where Zhou was born, the opera turns its tragic hero into a cypher-a primly perfect model worker, albeit one whose work is running the government. To signal that Zhou loved the people, he is shown working late while his aides fret about his health, and refusing a bowl of gruel because there are Chinese without enough to eat. Zhou the diplomat instantly impresses the visiting American president, Richard Nixon, who gasps in an aside: "This is a difficult opponent. He is so firm in his positions yet so polite, and he clearly knows a lot about America." A scene is devoted to Zhou's oratory at the Bandung Conference of non-aligned nations in 1955. When African and Asian envoys doubt China's sincerity, the Zhou of the opera recalls past humiliations inflicted by colonial powers on their two continents. Deeply moved, the gorgeously robed ministers bow and clasp his hand.
These cartoonish scenes involve both omissions-the horrors of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution are not mentioned and Mao is never seen-and distortions of the historical record. The real Zhou at the real Bandung Conference committed China to non-interference in other countries' internal affairs and cast America's nuclear arsenal as the greatest threat to world peace. The stage version struts and brags about the military firepower of a rising China, in language that would not look out of place in an online nationalist chat-room. "You know what people say, diplomacy only works within the range of your missiles," the operatic Zhou blusters. After his triumph at Bandung he assures his wife that China will be bullied no longer, saying: "I'm thankful that today we're no longer fish meat on somebody's chopping block."
Audience reactions show a generational divide. Though all spectators described an idealised Zhou, sketched out in the broad strokes of party propaganda, older Chinese at least nodded to the idea that the former prime minister suffered for the sake of the revolution, while trying to mitigate Mao's worst mistakes. "He swallowed humiliations and bore a heavy burden," murmured one old man, explaining his admiration for Zhou as he left the performance. In contrast, younger spectators reflected the tinny, chinjutting nationalism that suffuses life in today's China, hailing Zhou as a symbol of Chinese national strength vanquishing foreign humiliation-as if this subtle, disappointing man were an aircraft-carrier or high-speed train. A group of university students, one of whom had a bit part in the opera, furrowed their brows when asked about his significance. "He's all about giving to the people. Even after he got sick and fell to the ground, he'd stand back up and work some more," ventured one. Another hailed Zhou for promoting China's rise: "He's the one that reintroduced China to the world. Letting people know that our lives are getting better and our nation is stronger." Interviews inside the theatre were cut short by officials who shooed Chaguan away, calling an opera about a state leader a sensitive matter not fit for foreign reporters.
Committee-written art for a cramped, cautious China
A grand finale makes explicit the link between the opera and present-day propaganda. As a chorus sings lines from a poem by the teenage Zhou about studying abroad for the good of China, a large video screen flickers to life. Images of a modern Chinese space rocket and submarine fill the screen, then footage of troops, tanks and nuclear missiles from this month's national-day parade in Beijing. Crude and bossily patronising, the opera is of a piece with much official discourse in today's China. Zhou Enlai the diplomat and opera-lover might have shuddered.

全文文献: Headnote Why is it so hard to go meatless in China?
THE PLANET needs China to curb its appetite for meat. In the first three decades of the "reform and opening" era the number of farmed animals in the country tripled. Raising them polluted water supplies and gobbled up scarce arable land. Around the globe, China's growing hunger for red meat, specifically, has seen its beef imports grow 40-fold between 2010 and 2018. The boom threatens Latin American forests and Arctic ice caps alike, as cattle-rearing prompts land-clearing and emits greenhouse gases.
To be fair, China's 14.bn people are being asked to show a selfrestraint unknown in the gluttonous West. Even now, in a China where children yawn at dishes their grandparents once saw only at weddings and high holidays, meat consumption per person is only half of America's. But China's government, too, wants its people to eat less meat. Obesity, type-2 diabetes and high blood pressure are taking a growing toll. To curb such afflictions, guidelines issued in 2016 urge adults to eat just 40-75 grammes of meat a day, or about half the current national average. Market signals are also pushing shoppers to cut back. China's most popular meat, pork, is nearly 70% costlier than a year ago because herds are being wiped out by African swine fever, a disease harmless to people but lethal to pigs.
Even before this latest animal epidemic, Chinese living in wealthier cities were having qualms about excessive meat-eating. In 2017 a survey of big-city residents found 36% of respondents intending to eat less pork, red meat and poultry in the year ahead. They cited concerns about their health, the environment and food safety, in that order. But a solution common in other countries- declaring oneself strictly vegetarian or vegan-remains strikingly rare. Less than 2% of the Chinese population is vegetarian, the food industry estimates. The proportion is 10% in neighbouring Taiwan, an island with centuries of shared Chinese culture and history. Its contrast with China in terms of attitudes to vegetarianism reveals much about the mainland's society, and how it either embraces or resists change.
In the West, angst about animal welfare or disgust at the idea of meat are big motives for vegetarians. Chinese consumers are less squeamish. Few mention animal suffering in surveys about dietary choices, and fewer still a distaste for meat. This week Chaguan visited Number 8 Market, a bustling foodie's delight in the coastal city of Xiamen. He found locals admiring butcher's stalls resembling anatomy classrooms, with body parts from tongues to trotters laid out for inspection. Chen Zhiqiang, a young man giving a chunk of pork a discerning prod, concedes that some children claim to dislike meat. But it is necessary for their health, he declares, "so you have to sneak it into them with soup."
Nor are Xiamen's market-folk greatly impressed by showy self-denial-another staple of Western vegetarianism. China was too poor, too recently, to indulge in that sort of virtue-signalling. A fishmonger nicknamed A Feng remembers her own impoverished, largely meatless childhood. Today, she says, people can pursue a balanced diet, which she defines as meat twice or three times a week, with fish as an "everyday necessity". She is backed up by Ms Lin, a nearby seller of tofu, a staple of vegetarian Chinese dishes. Beancurd is nutritious stuff, says Ms Lin, but the human body "can't stand" a fully meatless diet. Some devout Buddhists go without meat on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, notes the tofu-seller, then "complain that they have no energy".
Alternative lifestyles are a hard sell in China. Those who shun meat are generally shy about standing out, says Zhou Qiyu, a manager at Whole Perfect Foods, a company founded in 1993. It specialises in mock meat, from plant-based sausages to hamburger patties made of peas, soyabeans, mushrooms and other vegetables. Even devoutly religious vegetarians want to be seen as part of society, he suggests, speaking at his company's stand at a vegetarian trade fair held in Xiamen's vast exhibition complex between October 10th and 14th. A desire to fit in makes mock meat "super appropriate" for entertaining non-vegetarian friends, he enthuses.
The Buddhist and Taoist faiths have long been pillars of Chinese vegetarianism. One reason for Taiwan's large number of vegetarians is that the island has never been ruled by the Communist Party and so was spared the Cultural Revolution, which from 1966-76 uprooted religious and cultural traditions on the mainland. Buddhist monks are meant to avoid any food that involves killing, though they may eat meat received as alms. The rules for lay believers are less strict but have still inspired several schools of Buddhist, meatless cooking, often involving elaborate mock-meat dishes, from fake ducks to fish carved from beancurd.
The vegetarian fair in Xiamen draws several Buddhist nuns and monks in grey or brown robes. Fa Man, a nun from Jiangsu province, sees a link between China's new prosperity and a greater interest in health, the environment and even in spiritual matters. All of that should strengthen vegetarianism, she beams.
Flexitarians of the world unite
Religious faith led David Yin to stop eating meat in his 30s. In 2012 he founded King's Joy, a vegetarian restaurant in a lovely courtyard beside the Lama Temple in old Beijing. Mr Yin and his son, Gary, the head chef, have ditched the traditional Buddhist prohibition on garlic and chives, flavourings known as "small meats" and shunned as too stimulating. Traditional vegetarian cooking for the devout allows only ginger as a spice, and with such strict rules "you lose too much flavour," says the elder Mr Yin. He hopes that clients-even if initially drawn by tree-shaded courtyards and famous guests-will see that plant-eating is healthy, tasty and respectful of the environment and animals. But, he admits, "My goal is aligned with reality, which is that 95% of our customers are not vegetarians." It is a shrewd way to promote social change in today's China, a place skittish about non-conformity: pragmatic and tactful towards the majority culture, with good food as a reward.

全文文献: Headnote Veterans of the Tiananmen protests view the crisis in Hong Kong with a terrible fatalism
HAN DONGFANG learned the hard way that the Communist Party of China will shed blood to enforce its will. As an activist during the democracy protests of 1989, he stood in a rumour-swept Tiananmen Square in early June and assured fearful comrades that, as a former soldier turned railway electrician, he was sure that the People's Liberation Army would never shoot fellow Chinese. Still haunted by that mistake, he felt alarm in September 2014 at the sight of democracy activists from the Occupy Central movement blocking streets in Hong Kong, his home in exile. Hurrying to the Occupy protests, Mr Han sat beside the youngsters and urged them to see reason. Stop blocking traffic, he advised, you are giving the police, or worse, Chinese soldiers waiting unseen in their Hong Kong barracks, an excuse to attack.
Jump forward to 2019, and a new generation of radical activists is all but daring China's rulers to send troops onto Hong Kong's streets, and, by spilling blood, show China's true nature. Whether they are trampling the Chinese flag, vandalising metro stations, attacking policemen or brawling with gangsters loyal to the party, hard-core protesters have brought a furious, burn-it-all-down energy to a movement once notable for its moderation. The first big marches, in June, belonged to a more innocent age, when Hong Kongers strolled peacefully in their hundreds of thousands to oppose a law that would expose them to the mainland's justice system. Some sang hymns or collected water bottles for recycling.
Today, the risks of provoking those in power are greater than ever. Hong Kong's police officers-visibly exhausted and embittered after 17 weeks upholding the authority of the territory's despised political leaders-stand ready to club, tear-gas and arrest anyone they deem a threat, while repeatedly turning a blind eye to violence by pro-Communist thugs. Hong Kong's military garrison has been reinforced with thousands of soldiers and paramilitary police from the mainland, answerable to the hard men in Beijing.
Mr Han has much to lose. Hong Kong's Western-style freedoms have not just offered him a haven. They allow him to run China Labour Bulletin, an organisation that campaigns for the rights of workers on the mainland. Yet for all that, he finds himself rethinking his advice to Occupy protesters to remain moderate. "During Occupy, I felt my experience in Tiananmen Square counted," Mr Han says. He now thinks his words of caution were "just bullshit" and an arrogant, "dinosaur kind of thinking". He says today's youngsters are much wiser about the party than he was 30 years ago. When youngsters declare themselves proud Hong Kongers who feel nothing for China, they are using their city's political and civic freedoms to define themselves and deny their Chinese identity, he marvels. Turning-points in history are not always rational, or good, or bad, he ventures. They just are.
Mr Han's new fatalism is revealing, and reflects a wider shift in public opinion. Though recent acts of violence by protesters dismay many, polls suggest that Hong Kongers are angrier still with the police and government, whose job is to uphold order and the law impartially. In the meantime, even those who oppose radical actions by protesters concede that moderation has not brought many rewards. Asked how this confrontation may end, Mr Han says that, though it may sound cruel to some, "How it ends no longer matters. What matters is that it already began." Either China can offer real democratic reforms to Hong Kong, he says, or it can use force and risk a crisis that will shake China and its periphery.
The Reverend Chu Yiu-ming was in his 40s when he witnessed the murderous suppression of the Tiananmen protests. Five years ago Mr Chu, a Baptist minister from Chai Wan in eastern Hong Kong, preached non-violence and quoted Martin Luther King as he co-founded the Occupy movement. Convicted of public-order offences for his role in that, Mr Chu, 75, only escaped prison on grounds of his age and public service. In an interview at his church he talks of sleepless nights worrying about youngsters on the streets today who are being arrested on charges of rioting, which could land them in prison for ten years. Yet he says that even "frontline fighters", as more radical protesters are known, enjoy support from across society. "When people face a life-threatening situation, it is natural to think of self-defence," he says. Sometimes sacrifices are needed to defend freedoms, he adds, recalling the church's past support of uprisings against dictatorships in the Philippines, East Germany and Poland. Hong Kongers are not trying to topple the party, he believes. They just want "one country, two systems" to mean that Hong Kong's government is answerable to its people. Asked if he fears another Tiananmen, the priest quotes a message from an intermediary familiar with President Xi Jinping's plans for Hong Kong: "No bloodshed, no compromises".
If accurate, that message suggests the party is preparing for a war of attrition. Sadly for China's rulers, the situation may be too unstable for that. Today's levels of police violence and political repression disgust many Hong Kongers, but are not brutal enough to deter protesters. Put another way, the crisis must either get better quickly thanks to bold government concessions, or much worse.
Hong Kong is never going back to how it was
Wang Dan, who was a student leader on Tiananmen, knows which outcome he expects. Reached in Washington where he now lives, he calls himself "extremely pessimistic". Hong Kongers are asking for democracy, a demand which party leaders will reject, Mr Wang notes. "Both sides do not have space to yield. I can't see a possible solution." Beyond the ranks of the most radical protesters, a striking number of youngsters express confidence that China would never dare set troops on them, because the costs to the country's reputation would be too high. Veterans of 1989 know better. That is why their support for Hong Kong's young sounds more like a tribute to courage than a prediction of success. The old-timers have seen history made before, and it was cruel.

摘要: The most revealing moment of the national day parade through Tiananmen Square on October 1st lasted just a few seconds. It came as China's fearsome new DF-41 nuclear missiles, capable of striking any city in America, neared Chaguan's press seat on the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Loudspeakers came to life as their camouflaged, many-wheeled carriers growled towards the grand gateway of the Forbidden City where President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders waited on a rostrum. Unseen voices explained how the weapons would ensure that China always retains a deterrent capability, thus safeguarding peace. Turning lyrical, the voices compared the missiles to large dragons that can hide in massive mountains or boundless seas before delivering earth-shaking blows. The hand-picked crowd erupted in spontaneous cheers. It is understandable, indeed inevitable, that a wealthier China would seek to become a great military power. What was not inevitable was that Xi would embrace populist, nostalgic, red-flag waving nationalism, while glossing over the party's terrible mistakes.

全文文献: Headnote Official celebrations of National Day showed a worrying contempt for history
THE MOST revealing moment of the national day parade through Tiananmen Square on October 1st lasted just a few seconds. It came as China's fearsome new DF-41 nuclear missiles, capable of striking any city in America, neared Chaguan's press seat on the Avenue of Eternal Peace. Loudspeakers came to life as their camouflaged, many-wheeled carriers growled towards the grand gateway of the Forbidden City where President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders waited on a rostrum. Unseen voices explained how the weapons would ensure that China always retains a deterrent capability, thus safeguarding peace. Turning lyrical, the voices compared the missiles to large dragons that can hide in massive mountains or boundless seas before delivering earth-shaking blows. The hand-picked crowd erupted in spontaneous cheers.
Those cheers reflect two messages conveyed by the parade, which marked 70 years of Communist rule. The first is that China wields such firepower that no country may safely defy it. The second is that China is great again thanks to the Communist Party which is, and has always been, a force for good.
That second message was pressed home by the civilian half of the parade, which began with open-topped, gold-painted buses carrying red princelings and other descendants of Communist China's founders and martyrs. One was a grandson of Mao Zedong, squeezed into a general's uniform. The point was reinforced by marchers dressed as Mao-era farmers, soldiers and workers, dancing and singing in celebration of party-ordained campaigns of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s to tame nature, mobilise the masses and turn China into an industrial power. Such sanitising of the Mao years is indecent. On balance those were lost decades that left millions of Chinese dead, whether from man-made famines, class warfare or ideological purges. Yet under Mr Xi, the twists, turns and dead-ends of party rule have been tidily woven into a glorious story of national progress. China's boss has not hidden his motives. He links the Soviet Union's collapse to the moment that Russian leaders disavowed crimes by Stalin and other Communist leaders. Mr Xi has chosen another course, curtailing the party's previous, limited tolerance for historical candour.
Previous parades have nodded to live debates. On national day in 1984 Deng Xiaoping, then China's leader, said the country's primary task was to reform the economy to remove obstacles to growth. That parade included busts of leaders purged or sidelined under Mao, and a float from Shekou, a pioneering special economic zone that Deng's leftist critics called capitalist.
In elite settings, largely for the benefit of insiders, Mr Xi has repudiated past crimes by ultra-leftists who were deemed by Deng to have deviated from the party line. Honouring revolutionary heroes on the eve of this year's national day, Mr Xi remembered Zhang Zhixin, a party member executed in 1975 for speaking out against Mao-era excesses, though not before her larynx was cut to stop her calling to fellow inmates as she died.
No such candour is offered to the masses. The true story of China's recovery from Maoist ruin was written by hundreds of millions of individual Chinese. They were enabled to raise themselves from poverty through hard work and risk-taking, after Deng pragmatically embraced market forces. Yet in this year's parade, a vast painting of Deng in a Mao suit was escorted by identically dressed dancers waving fronds of grain, as if he were the skilled boss of a collective farm rather than the man who let peasants grow their own crops, transforming rural lives. Later floats, lauding the Xi era, showed such centrally planned glories as high-speed trains and space rockets. Some of the few visible representatives of private enterprise were delivery drivers on scooters, a low-paid group once praised by Mr Xi for being like diligent bees. In apparent homage to this simile, the parade's delivery drivers wore yellow and black hats topped with bee antennae, like heroes in a children's book. As if vanquishing the ghosts of the Tiananmen protests of 1989, students from the city's universities marched beneath their college flags, hopping with excitement as they saw Mr Xi, through air still heavy with the fumes from parading tanks.
China's nationalism is the world's problem
It is understandable, indeed inevitable, that a wealthier China would seek to become a great military power. What was not inevitable was that Mr Xi would embrace populist, nostalgic, red-flag waving nationalism, while glossing over the party's terrible mistakes. Traditionally, those urging China to reckon honestly with the past have appealed to rational self-interest. Brave, embattled liberals have called for more open debate about the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, to prevent such mistakes from being repeated. That argument feels weak today. Mr Xi is not a revolutionary like Mao, bent on dismantling the party. Rather, he is an authoritarian obsessed with stability, determined to assert the party's absolute authority. To that end his team is happy to harness Maoist rhetoric, nostalgia for a simpler, less materialist China and the public's justifiable pride in the endurance of past hardships. Judged cynically, such propaganda is astute domestic politics. Mao-style strongman rule is still a danger, but there is little risk of a return to the mayhem of the Cultural Revolution.
Other countries may have more to fear from Mr Xi's embrace of false history. By telling his people that Communist China has never taken a wrong turn, he is stoking an impatient, hair-trigger nationalism in which criticism from abroad equates to hostility.
China is not the first rising power to seek fearsome weapons. Its people's patriotism cannot be dismissed as brainwashing. Many are clear-eyed and rational in their love for their country and support for Mr Xi. But heavily armed, self-righteous nationalism can start wars. Both China and the rest of the world would be somewhat safer if party chiefs were to acknowledge their fallibility. That Mr Xi is heading in the other direction should alarm everybody.

全文文献: Headnote China's rulers want the undivided loyalty of their subjects. That is causing a tragedy in Hong Kong
OVER THE past four months as many as 2m Hong Kongers-or more than a quarter of the city's residents-have marched to demand the scrapping of a bill that would have exposed criminal suspects to the mainland's courts. Those protests were a stunning vote of no confidence in China's Communist-controlled legal system. They worked: the extradition bill is being withdrawn.
It is hard to imagine a clearer rallying cry for the many mainlanders who distrust their own justice system. Their cousins in Hong Kong, guaranteed access to independent courts and uncensored news under the rubric of "one country, two systems", could not bear to live as mainlanders must every day. But dissent in Hong Kong has not proved contagious.
Not all i.4bn mainlanders think alike, but there are no reports of any of them marching in sympathy. That may be in part because, thanks to the unsleeping censors who guard the Great Firewall of China, many know nothing of the extradition debate. But it is also because an unknowable but significant number accept the narrative of China's media that treacherous radicals in Hong Kong, perhaps funded by the CIA, are trying to split the motherland. The widespread acceptance of this narrative is a testament to the government's success in shaping the way its citizens see the world.
Yet China's propaganda machine, so effective at home, is making a fool of itself in Hong Kong. When officials try to peddle the idea that a silent majority in Hong Kong loves China, their efforts strike many people in the territory as laughable. Communist-controlled outfits in Hong Kong have often simply copied successful stunts by protesters. In mid-September pro-democracy marchers hiked up a local peak, Lion Rock, creating a chain of lights with smartphones, torches and laser pointers as dusk fell. The next day a smaller group of red-clad patriots puffed up the same hill to wave a giant national flag, in images heavily promoted by the mainland's media. When youngsters in Hong Kong packed shopping centres to sing a new protest anthem, small bands of the party faithful were mobilised to belt out China's national anthem in the territory's malls.
On the eve of a spectacular parade in Beijing on October 1st, when tanks and nuclear missiles will trundle past President Xi Jinping to mark 70 years of the People's Republic, it is worth pondering the domestic success of China's propaganda apparatus, and its external cluelessness. That machine is best understood as a giant, state-directed monopoly. Within China, it has grown strong. But in free markets fizzing with ideas and arguments from around the world, China's patriotic sloganeering falls flat.
In Hong Kong the city's former colonial master, Britain, left behind an awkward hybrid. The territory has the political culture and education system of a liberal democracy. But its leaders are mostly appointed, with only a minority of political offices opened to direct election. Since Mr Xi became the Communist Party's boss, China has betrayed its impatience with even that limited accountability, and the central government's agents have worked to marginalise competing voices.
In 2012, the year Mr Xi took over, the Hong Kong government tried to impose "national education" on schools, but retreated in the face of mass protests. Politicians seeking greater autonomy or even independence (a minority view) have been barred from office or from running for office. A national-anthem law demanded by Beijing, if passed, would make criminals of Hong Kongers who boo the tune at football games.
The results may be heard in Hong Kong's shopping centres almost every night. Strolling this week through Kowloon, Chaguan chanced upon a few dozen youngsters who had been summoned by Telegram, an encrypted social-media app, to sing the protest anthem in the atrium of a shopping complex.
Nic, a 25-year-old protester, described his mixed identity. He does not imagine that Hong Kong can be independent, noting that 50 years after the handover from Britain the promise of one country, two systems will expire. "In 2047 we will return to China fully, we understand that," he says. "But we are trying to protect what we have until the last day." When he travels, his passport says "Hong Kong, China". But when asked who he is, he replies: a Hong Konger. "China is not what we are proud of," he explains. "The Chinese government sucks."
Politics in Hong Kong is turning dangerously tribal. Rather than a debate about policies, it is becoming an argument about who is good and who is bad, who is bent on saving Hong Kong or on destroying it. In that culture war politicians who sympathise with the party conflate flag-waving patriotism with legitimacy. That has led them to endorse "patriotic" thugs and alleged gang members, including when they assaulted protesters in the far-northern district of Yuen Long in July. That single incident changed the nature of the demonstrations, says Cheng Chung-Tai, chairman of Civic Passion, a party that wants more autonomy for Hong Kong. After Yuen Long, showing resistance and defiance to authority became a badge of belonging to the group that sees itself as defending the territory. "Last Sunday Tseung Kwan O got tear-gas for the first time. They celebrated," notes Mr Cheng, referring to an operation by police to quell protests in an eastern district.
No room for a loyal opposition
Little in Mr Xi's record suggests that he will respond generously and imaginatively to Hong Kong's identity crisis. In other peripheral territories, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, he has authorised brute force backed by high-tech surveillance and a pounding drumbeat of propaganda to crush hybrid identities. Hong Kong, a still-vibrant if troubled world city, will be harder to bring to heel. Alas, 70 years after its founding, China is hostile even to constrained forms of pluralism. That is why, wherever people have choices, it inspires fear or awe, but not love.

Mazu is a tenth-century maiden who miraculously saved relatives from a shipwreck and later became a goddess.

全文文献: Headnote Why Communist Party bosses love Mazu, a folk goddess of the sea
There are several ways to gauge whether the Communist Party of China approves of an institution. A brass nameplate, issued by an arm of the party or state, is one sign. A stamp for endorsing important materials can be used as a further badge of respectability. But the best test of approved status, arguably, is the issuing of lots of paperwork. Somewhat surprisingly, a Ming dynasty temple hidden up an alleyway off Shipu harbour, one of eastern China's largest fishing ports, passes all these tests.
An incense-scented haven of red woodwork and worn grey flagstones, the temple is dedicated to Mazu, a tenth-century maiden who miraculously saved relatives from a shipwreck and later became a goddess. Older residents remember when the temple risked destruction as a den of feudal superstition. During the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, when sacred sites were razed by Maoist zealots and countless priests and monks were harried to death, the temple became a primary school. Red Guards tried to ransack the place, says Han Sulian, a temple volunteer. But locals "threatened to beat them up so they backed off", she recalls with pride. Sailors never stopped believing in Mazu, adds Ms Han. They would wear incense pouches as secret talismans when they left Shipu to hunt eels and yellow croaker in the East China Sea.
Today, fishermen need not hide their prayers. Chaguan visited the temple on September 16th, hours before party bigwigs and other officials arrived. They were in Shipu to open a new fishing season, ending a ban imposed on May 1st to allow exhausted stocks a chance of recovery. A brass plate on the temple's weathered façade shows it is licensed by the Ethnic and Religious Affairs Committee of Zhejiang province. Inside, new banners in embroidered yellow satin lie on the altar, ready for marking in red ink with the temple's stamp, before being flown from boats' masts. Paperwork, in the form of stacks of prayer slips, combines belief and bureaucracy. A slip bears the hull numbers of two ships, their skippers' names and handwritten appeals for the boats to encounter calm seas and return with full holds. Crews will burn their slips before leaving Shipu, a pretty harbour surrounded by steep wooded hills. Meanwhile local women busy themselves sorting bottles of wine, left over from a fishermen's banquet the night before. That open-air feast, overseen by beaming officials and filmed by state television, culminated in a waterborne procession of illuminated trawlers. The boats carried statues of Mazu and other deities past tourists on the harbourside, glowing smartphone cameras held aloft.
The party remains officially atheist. Though formal tolerance of five faiths-Buddhism, Daoism, Islam and two strands of Christianity, Protestantism and Catholicism-was reinstated in 1982, six years after the death of Mao Zedong, rules have tightened under President Xi Jinping. He has called for the "sinicisation" of religion. In plainer language this means that all beliefs must in the end bow to a worldlier credo, involving party-ordained patriotism and family values. Organs of state repression have targeted Muslims accused of excessive piety, particularly in the western region of Xinjiang, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims, mostly from the Uighur minority, have been detained in re-education camps. Tibetan Buddhists live in a surveillance state largely closed to foreigners. Even in prosperous Zhejiang, officials have ordered crosses that are too prominent to be torn off hundreds of Christian churches, and shut down unofficial "house churches". In contrast certain forms of faith are encouraged, especially those with roots in China and big followings among overseas Chinese. Mazu-worship fits that bill. Over the centuries migrants from China's maritime provinces have built temples to the goddess, also known as Tianhou, from Macau to Malaysia and Melbourne. Helpfully, Mazu worship is classed as a folk belief and not as a religion, notes Zhou Jinyan of the China Mazu Cultural Exchange Association, a semiofficial body. That allows for looser regulation and for the faith's promotion for economic and political ends.
Mazu has a big following in Taiwan. In 2011 Mr Xi urged officials to "make full use" of Mazu to woo Taiwanese, most of whom have ancestral ties with the mainland. Taiwanese money built a gaudy new temple to Ruyi, a sister deity of Mazu's, on a hill above Shipu. A lot of it came from relatives of the late "Blacky" Ko Sau Leung, a popular crooner and stuntman known for jumping the Yellow River in a sports car. Ko was among thousands of Zhejiang folk who were evacuated to Nationalist-held Taiwan in 1955 when the offshore islands they called home were overrun by Communist forces, some years after China's civil war. Many settled in the Taiwanese port of Fugang, nicknamed "little Shipu". Fugang believers are honoured guests at Shipu's fishing festival, bustling about in tshirts reading "Goddess of the Sea".
For those in peril on the sea
Grand ceremonies for Mazu were unknown 40 years ago when Zhou Quanyang, the owner of a 150-tonne fishing boat, was a boy, and China a much poorer place. "It's when your belly is full and you have some money, that's when you pray," says Mr Zhou. Every fisherman has faith in Mazu, he says, as the town's 2,800 vessels are readied for the fishing season. His own daughter, a university student, does not believe, he adds. This prompts unexpected sympathy from Chaguan's minder, an official from the local county propaganda office listening to the exchange. With a father in such a dangerous line of work, that daughter "should probably believe more, and pray for her dad", the minder exclaims.
Mazu has competition, revealed by the Chinese characters for "Emmanuel" discreetly painted on a few ships putting to sea. Perhaps 100 boats are Christian-owned, claims Peter, a local Protestant. Party leaders see Christianity as a foreign intruder, he laments. That is why they promote folk religion and "cultural confidence". Yet the fishing life calls for deeper faith, Peter argues: the ocean reminds man how small he is in the face of nature. ?

摘要: Around five in the morning is the most lethal time on China's motorways, says a transport-industry veteran. The peril comes from long-distance lorry drivers, whose vehicles may have been rolling for days, pausing only for fuel and the rest stops required by law: 20 minutes every four hours, with no daily limit on driving. As dawn breaks, a long-haul trucker may be munching sunflower seeds and sipping cold tea to stay awake, while a driving partner dozes on a bunk bed. To help that partner sleep, the windows may be closed. Many Chinese do not think about long-haul lorries enough to be scared of them. China's 30 meters lorry drivers are vital but invisible. Their toil helped the country become a manufacturing juggernaut. This explosion in mobility, involving the creation of a vast highway network and a high-tech logistics industry in less than a generation, has brought Chinese truckers neither fame nor respect.

全文文献: Headnote Hitching a ride with China's unsung army of 30m long-distance drivers
AROUND FIVE in the morning is the most lethal time on China's motorways, says a transport-industry veteran. The peril comes from long-distance lorry drivers, whose vehicles may have been rolling for days, pausing only for fuel and the rest stops required by law: 20 minutes every four hours, with no daily limit on driving. As dawn breaks, a long-haul trucker may be munching sunflower seeds and sipping cold tea to stay awake, while a driving partner dozes on a bunk bed. To help that partner sleep, the windows may be closed. The only sound may be the tinny tones of a satellitenavigation device. Such drivers "are like ticking bombs, you don't know if they are awake or asleep," says the veteran, adding that as a result wise travellers avoid highways until after seven.
If that makes drivers sound a bit unloved, the reality is sadder. Many Chinese do not think about long-haul lorries enough to be scared of them. China's 30m lorry drivers are vital but invisible. Their toil helped the country become a manufacturing juggernaut. It is now feeding a consumer-spending boom, as middle-class Chinese order anything from a sofa to a selfie-stick with a tap on a smartphone, for express delivery at cut-price rates. This explosion in mobility, involving the creation of a vast highway network and a high-tech logistics industry in less than a generation, has brought Chinese truckers neither fame nor respect. When America and western Europe experienced similar transport booms in the 20th century, popular culture made folk heroes of long-distance drivers-brawny, taciturn types who prefer to brave blizzards than obey a foreman on a factory floor. Hollywood made films about wisecracking, heartbreaking truckers outsmarting policemen and other authority figures. Country singers recorded tributes like the hit of 1975, "Convoy" ("Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way"). Soon after becoming president Donald Trump invited truckers to the White House, climbed into a big rig and blasted its air horn, burnishing his blue-collar rebel credentials.
In contrast, China's rulers are wary of authority-flouting loners. Greeting scooter-riding delivery workers in Beijing before the Chinese new year, President Xi Jinping offered them a thoroughly collective compliment, beaming that they were "busy as bees".
Chaguan recently cadged a ride from Liu Chengbing, a 43-yearold lorry driver, as he began a run from Beijing to a chemicals plant in the coastal city of Jiaxing. Back in the 1990s drivers had a pretty high status, Mr Liu recalled. They earned good salaries, though most had only a middle-school education. They could make a still better living if they bought their own lorry and then touted for jobs, perhaps by handing out cards at factories. Self-employment is harder today. Margins are shrinking and repeat deliveries go to logistics firms. In June 2018 caravans of drivers used social media to organise nationwide protests about fuel prices, low incomes and the market dominance of a few, Uber-like load-finding apps.
Mr Liu sometimes takes his wife along in the cab to help with navigation, parking, food and accounts-a common practice. Like so many migrant workers, Mr Liu lives in the east, near Hangzhou, leaving his sons, 16 and 12, with their grandparents in rural Sichuan. Mr Liu can earn over 10,000 yuan ($1,400) a month. At least as a specialist driver of dangerous goods his hours are limited, and night-driving banned. Asked why lorry drivers are not heroes in Chinese films, he snorts, adjusting the brace that he wears for a painful back. "When I load stuff at the factory, the security guard sort of orders me around. That shows you our status," he says. Near Cangzhou, south of Beijing, a traffic jam allows Mr Liu time for a swift roadside pee, a cigarette and a spot of kung-fu style highkicking. He does not chat with nearby drivers. Truckers are not especially sociable, Mr Liu explains, back in the cab. One exception is on social media such as WeChat, where drivers share tips about bad traffic, good food and clean guesthouses. Some lorry drivers, including some of the roughtly one in 25 who are women, have built followings on Kuaishou, a video-sharing app. Mr Liu does not fear self-driving lorries taking jobs. "Maybe for smaller cars," he muses. But for big lorries like his, hauling a tank of sulphuric acid plastered with warning signs, "you're going to need a guy."
A nationwide survey of the industry, published by the Social Sciences Academic Press in 2018, found that more than 71% of drivers own their vehicles, often after borrowing heavily. A big majority are from rural areas and are married with children. On average, drivers see their families once every 20 days. Asked if they would like their children to drive lorries, nearly 96% said no.
Rugged individualists with Chinese characteristics
Mats Harborn, a Beijing-based executive at Scania, a Swedish lorry-maker, has devoted years to promoting a Western-style "truck culture" in China, including driving contests that hail truckers as "heroes". In part, this is to sell expensive imported lorries with fuel efficiency that makes them good value in the long run, but only if they are well driven. In part, Mr Harborn sees a broader need to help China develop a safe, sophisticated transport sector, rather than a "Wild East" industry plagued by overcapacity.
Imported lorries are mostly bought by big logistics firms, and give drivers bragging rights among their peers, says Harry Huang of Volvo Trucks, another Swedish firm. Their comfort and safety- including gadgets that brake automatically if they detect a sleepy driver-may help deal with the industry's chronic recruitment problems, he suggests, standing on the sidelines of a Volvo driving contest in the southern province of Guangdong. One contestant, Shao Panpan, drives the same route all year, connecting Suzhou with Harbin, more than 2,300km to the north. Each leg involves four days of non-stop driving, shared with a partner. He likes the job, and does not mind sharing a cab for days on end. "The partner thing is like a marriage, you need to get along and compromise," Mr Shao says. Still, round-the-clock driving is hard. "Our bodies wear out faster than other people's." He can expect little thanks.

摘要: The democratic island of Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in May, over the objections of conservatives steeped in Chinese cultural and religious values. For now, same-sex unions remain unthinkable on the Chinese mainland. Marriage between one man and one woman "suits our country's national condition and historical and cultural traditions", a spokesman for China's parliament declared in August. Here, how LGBT groups protect themselves is discussed.

全文文献: Headnote Gay Chinese take a cautious first step towards civil unions
TWO DECADES ago there were no gay men in China. That, at least, was the claim of a senior Chinese official when asked what proportion of his country's hiv cases involved homosexual transmission. His questioner, a government minister visiting from Britain in 2000, offered her host a wager: £100 that there were, in fact, gay Chinese. "I note that he didn't take the bet," the minister scoffed as she related the exchange to a clutch of Beijing-based reporters later that day. The British ambassador, teacup frozen in mid-air, hastily declared the minister's comments off-the-record.
Chaguan attended that long-ago embassy tea party during a first posting to China. Back then Communist Party officials routinely called same-sex attraction a sickness carried by foreigners and Chinese doctors classified it as a mental disorder. Criminal penalties for homosexual acts were abolished only in 1997.
A generation later, that era of denial seems almost quaint. On September 2nd Chaguan interviewed Peng Yanzi and Yang Yi, an openly-indeed cheerfully-gay Chinese couple, about their plans to register as one another's legal guardian. Amid much joking and finishing of each other's sentences in a coffee shop in Guangzhou, their southern home town, Mr Peng, 36, and Mr Yang, 31, explained the documents they are drafting with the help of a local public notary. The mutual agreement will allow each to take medical and some financial decisions for the other, should they grow infirm, undergo surgery or otherwise lose their faculties. They are among a pioneering band of same-sex Chinese couples taking advantage of a guardianship law initially drafted with the elderly in mind. This was amended in 2017 to cover all adults. A few months later creative lawyers and activists realised that registering as mutual guardians could give same-sex couples some legal protections, even if those fall well short of those provided by gay marriage.
The democratic island of Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in May, over the objections of conservatives steeped in Chinese cultural and religious values. For now, same-sex unions remain unthinkable on the Chinese mainland. Marriage between one man and one woman "suits our country's national condition and historical and cultural traditions", a spokesman for China's parliament declared in August.
"We're using what we can find in the current legal system to protect ourselves," says Mr Peng, who works for lgbt Rights Advocacy China, an ngo. He lives in an unusually laid-back metropolis. But mutual guardianships between gay people have also been signed in other cities, including Changsha, Nanjing and Shanghai. Nationwide attention was sparked in August when a notary's office in Beijing, where every act is weighed for its political correctness, approved the capital's first known same-sex guardianship agreement. Almost as significant, to activists, was the neutral, even supportive coverage of the event in state-owned media. Posts about mutual guardianship in Beijing have cumulatively earned over 100m views on Weibo, a microblogging platform.
Official tolerance is not unlimited. Several notarial offices have used social media to announce same-sex guardianship agreements, only to swiftly delete the posts. Censors have stepped up efforts to shield Chinese audiences from depictions of gay life in films, on television and online. In late 2018 a female author of gay erotic fiction was jailed for ten years on pornography charges.
Mr Peng and Mr Yang face a dilemma that is familiar to all who try to build a stronger civil society in China. They hope to see many more couples take advantage of mutual guardianship. They were shaken when a lesbian friend died, whereupon her parents took possession of her home and car, leaving her long-standing partner bereft. "We realised that in the eyes of the law, they were still strangers even after living together for six or seven years," says Mr Peng about the lesbian couple. "Like roommates," interjects Mr Yang. Beyond the practical benefits of guardianship, increasing the visibility of gay Chinese is a long-term goal. However, they would prefer not to attract too much attention, in case the government-which has yet to signal its view of same-sex guardianship agreements-decides that it disapproves.
Ready to hold up their bit of the sky
Gay groups in China take striking care to avoid terms liable to alarm the party, such as human or civil rights. Instead they stress how gay love is compatible with traditional family values. One of China's largest support groups, Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, gives pride of place to parents who profess their acceptance of their children's homosexuality. One of the group's recent meetings in Beijing was conspicuously wholesome. Smartly dressed mothers sat around the edge of the room, making small talk about options for reaching the gathering by public transport, and politely admiring smartphone pictures of each other's offspring. Meanwhile, youngsters in campaign т-shirts put out folding chairs and rainbow flags. Once under way, the meeting featured testimonials from mothers and their lesbian daughters about family heartbreak and forgiveness.
Ming, a 22-year old student at the meeting, is guardedly optimistic. The party no longer seeks to control every aspect of people's personal lives as it did decades ago, she says. She sees government caution about gay marriage as a bid to avoid affronting majority public opinion. Attitudes to gay rights are generational, she reports. She has not come out to her own parents, who think of homosexuality as a disease. That is why her real name is not used here. But once those born in or after the 1990s become China's mainstream, "I believe things will be different," Ming says.
Until then, gay campaigners will stress small, pragmatic steps like mutual guardianship. China's rulers are obsessed with maintaining social stability. Gay Chinese couples are ready to help, by taking responsibility for their own welfare. At least the party now admits they exist.

摘要: The tactics of China's Communist Party in their confrontation with Hong Kong which is likened to the Mongol armies at the peak of Kublai Khan's empire-building career is explored. Videos have been released showing Chinese soldiers practising riot suppression and paramilitary police massing just across the border from Hong Kong. Officials have declared weeks of pro-democracy marches and anti-government protests, many of them vast and peaceful but some of them small and violent, amount to a colour revolution with elements of terrorism. Like Mongol missives zinging over city walls, the government's threats are at once serious and a stratagem to frighten Hong Kongers into disowning the protesters and suing for peace.

全文文献: Headnote How China might bring Hong Kong to heel without sending troops from the mainland
At the peak of Kublai Khan's empire-building career, his reputation for ferocity was such that Mongol armies conquered some cities with handwritten notes, wrapped around arrows and fired over the walls. A typical letter urged inhabitants to submit at once to avoid a siege that was sure to end in mass slaughter. Vanquished local rulers, if lucky, might be granted a princely death, sewn into a sack and then trampled by horses.
Though China's Communist Party probably dislikes comparisons to a Mongol horde, its leaders are trying similar tactics in their confrontation with Hong Kong. Videos have been released showing Chinese soldiers practising riot suppression and paramilitary police massing just across the border from Hong Kong. Officials have declared that 12 weeks of pro-democracy marches and anti-government protests, many of them vast and peaceful but some of them small and violent, amount to a "colour revolution" with elements of "terrorism". Well-briefed Hong Kong tycoons have hinted at a deadline for displays of defiance by the territory to end: October 1st, when the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China will be marked in Beijing with a grand parade. On August 25 th the state news agency, Xinhua, reported on a gathering of officials to study speeches by Deng Xiaoping, the leader who devised the "one country, two systems" model, a promise to preserve Hong Kong's Western-style freedoms after British rule ended in 1997. That pledge of autonomy is quite compatible with sending troops to crack skulls, Xinhua reported: Deng himself stipulated that if Hong Kong drifted into turmoil, the central government should intervene.
Nobody should doubt that, if they sense Hong Kong sliding out of control, China's leaders would use violence to preserve their authority, even if that would spark massive civil disobedience, tank Hong Kong's stock- and property markets, and risk pushing American politicians, notably in Congress, from suspicion of China into a full-blown cold war. Yet, like Mongol missives zinging over city walls, the government's threats are at once serious and a stratagem to frighten Hong Kongers into disowning the protesters and suing for peace. For sending in troops would be an admission of failure.
Privately, some informed figures in Beijing play down the idea that October 1st is a deadline for ending the impasse, murmuring that Hong Kong, a tiny place of 7m people, cannot overshadow celebrations by a motherland of 1.4.bn citizens. That raises a question: if China is signalling that it is at once implacable but somewhat patient, what do party leaders have in mind for Hong Kong?
Multiple, overlapping campaigns are likely to enforce loyalty to China. One campaign is visibly under way within that part of Hong Kong that resembles an oligarchy. Chinese officials have scolded tycoons for allowing society to become so unequal and unaffordable. A best-case scenario would see curbs on magnates' rent-seeking. Less happily, officials have told company bosses to suppress dissent among their employees or quit, as happened to the chief executive of Hong Kong's flagship airline, Cathay Pacific.
Less visible, but just as important, is a looming purge within the bit of Hong Kong that resembles a technocracy: the world of professionals who, for better or worse, have helped to run Hong Kong since colonial times, in the absence of full democracy. With youngsters dominating so many protests, Hong Kong's schools and university campuses will be early targets for scrutiny. Ominously, a prominent pro-mainland politician talks of educators who "hate China" and teach the same to their students.
Hong Kong has already seen attempts to marginalise pro-democracy voices in civil society for more than a decade. Now professionals are braced for a second purge, targeting pro-business conservatives who side with the government 80% or 90% of the time, but who-notably as the current protests began in opposition to a proposed extradition law that would have exposed Hong Kongers to the mainland's criminal justice system-have voiced qualms or urged the authorities to make concessions. Such conservatives have long dominated such bodies as the Law Society or the Institute of Engineers, which in turn help fill umpteen disciplinary panels and advisory committees that make Hong Kong tick. Others sit in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), often representing "functional constituencies" consisting of a few thousand members of this or that industry or profession.
Better Red than expert
Mainland institutions that once shunned the spotlight, notably the central government's Liaison Office, are increasingly open in their lobbying. Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy politician and barrister who represents the legal constituency in LegCo, notes that particular controversy surrounds elections within professional bodies that allow for proxy voting. Junior members of law firms are routinely told to hand over proxy votes to partners, charges Mr Kwok. Then at election time, firms "get calls from clients, or from the Bank of China", urging block-voting for candidates favoured by the Liaison Office. Time and again, China-friendly "Reds" are driving out old-school conservatives, says Mr Kwok. The authorities in Beijing "want people who are absolutely loyal".
Several professionals describe how architects, lawyers, engineers and the like are urged to join study tours of the mainland. Lectures and visits to Chinese patriotic sites allow the Liaison Office and its allies to scout for potential recruits. Later, reunions are organised back in Hong Kong, creating networks. Loyalists can expect lucrative projects and offers of work on the mainland.
Such patronage politics lacks the drama of troops on the streets. It will still disgust many Hong Kongers, for the city's political culture-as millions of marchers have made clear-includes a respect for individual rights and accountable government wholly alien to the bossy, collectivist, croneyish autocrats in Beijing. Alas, as Kublai Khan knew, not all conquests require invasion.

摘要: The desire of China's online nationalists to be both loved and feared by the West is explored. Communist Party social-media accounts have asserted that foreign firms must work harder to uphold China's sacred territorial unity or feel the cold wrath of patriotic consumers. The nationalist anger is deemed as can be manipulated and sincere at the same time. Those attacking foreign brands are unusually worldly, whether they hail from the aspiring middle classes or are members of China's globe-trotting elites. Brands have been attacked over the precise wording of English-language apologies posted on platforms that are banned in China, such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. That means either overseas Chinese are involved, or netizens with access to online tools that allow them to vault the firewall.

全文文献: Headnote China's thin-skinned online nationalists want to be both loved and feared by the West
On august ioth a Chinese fashion blogger, "Stylist Zoe", invited her 7.4m followers to take an online poll, asking whether they would wear freshly cooked shrimp as earrings. A mere 1,300 voted. Two days later, however, Zoe hit the jackpot. Over a million netizens responded to her poll, posted on Weibo, the country's largest microblog platform, asking what followers think of foreign brands that "insult China". Her timing was impeccable. Her survey surfed waves of patriotic indignation crashing over the Chinese internet, heightened by puffs of windy outrage in the state media.
This tempest involves a charge new to the annals of great power competition: that Western brands have been subverting China's sovereignty by means of overpriced T-shirts. Specifically, Versace, Coach and Givenchy were denounced for selling T-shirts that variously bore the place-names Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan, without adding wording making it clear that the first two cities are not in fact sovereign states, but Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, and without specifying that-at least in the view of the Communist mainland-the democratic, self-governing island of Taiwan is a province of China.
Not content with going after designer-shirt peddlers, state-run news outlets have denounced Amazon for selling "Free Hong Kong" T-shirts, though the online giant does not operate inside China. Other well-known brands have been taken to task for dropdown location menus on company websites that could be interpreted as suggesting that Hong Kong and Taiwan are countries.
To outsiders, these alleged offences may seem footling. But luxury brands-whose largest single market is often China-offered grovelling apologies. Expressions of contrition from foreign designers and CEOs were paraded across social-media sites, joined by resignation letters from Chinese celebrities, noisily quitting as envoys for errant brands and stressing their love for the motherland.
One possible take on this dispiriting saga is that China's hairtrigger patriots are themselves victims. In this telling, if young Chinese netizens are easily offended, it is because they have spent their formative years cut off from the world behind a Great Firewall of digital censorship, and pounded by a drumbeat of nationalism.
A closer look at those online nationalists is more troubling. It is true that government propagandists have worked hard to whip up this latest storm. Communist Party social-media accounts have gleefully asserted that foreign firms must work harder to uphold China's sacred territorial unity, or feel the "cold, cold" wrath of i.4bn patriotic consumers.
But a sad truth about nationalist anger is that it can be manipulated and sincere at the same time. No party commissar told Stylist Zoe's followers to choose the most extreme response in her poll, vowing that they would rather go naked than wear clothes from an anti-China brand, yet 770,000 of them did so. More sobering still, by definition those attacking foreign brands are unusually worldly, whether they hail from the aspiring middle classes or are members of China's globe-trotting elites. Those advocating boycotts know their Versace from their Valentino. Their ringleaders also clearly have access to the internet beyond the Great Firewall. Brands have been attacked, in recent days, over the precise wording of English-language apologies posted on platforms that are banned in China, such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. That means either overseas Chinese are involved, or netizens with access to online tools that allow them to vault the firewall.
Some unhappy patriots hold plum jobs at the foreign companies under attack. Chaguan spoke this week to a Chinese staffer employed by one of the firms accused of insulting China. The staffer described Chinese colleagues debating their firm's actions on WeChat, a social media app ubiquitous in China, adding that Western colleagues "either didn't dare or didn't want to talk about it with Chinese staff". The firm did not set out to offend China, the employee believes. But China's market power deserves more deference: "If you make a profit from us, you also need to respect us."
If recent mistakes by luxury brands seem small to foreigners, they are missing the larger causes of Chinese anger, says "FashionModels", a blogger with 9m followers on Weibo, speaking via social media while on a trip to Japan. America and Europe remain "culturally more powerful" than China and have yet to change "their very condescending attitude", he says.
When more than T-shirts were at stake
History offers insights into today's online Chinese nationalism, with its complicated blend of assertiveness and insecurity. Arguably China's first modern consumer boycott began in 1905, targeting American goods. It was launched by Shanghai merchants in protest at the (very real) mistreatment of Chinese immigrants in America. The first law against Chinese immigration was passed in 1882. But as Wong Sin Kiong of the National University of Singapore has documented, the boycott took off only after American immigration officers began humiliating educated Chinese as well as labourers. America, in effect, provoked a test of national dignity involving many social classes. Newfangled technology also helped. The telegraph, the WeChat of its day, allowed far-flung Chinese to share tales of outrage and to organise.
One more parallel is important. Patriotic pride back in 1905 was mingled with shame, and soul-searching questions about why the Chinese were too dazzled by foreign goods to resist them for very long. Jump to 2019 and not much has changed. A popular comment on Stylist Zoe's poll laments that Chinese fashion-lovers are too quick to forgive brands that insult the country.
A big difference is that the boycott in 1905 had a moral argument at its core, and hurt Chinese merchants as much as American ones. Today's campaigns often turn on trivialities and are painless or even profitable for their promoters. Propagandists have done their work well. They have made indignation an industry. ?

全文文献: Headnote Why Communist officials imagine that America is behind unrest in Hong Kong
THERE IS SOMETHING depressing about the Chinese government's claim that foreign "black hands" are behind the protests in Hong Kong. For the claim is both nonsensical and, in mainland China, widely believed. It is a fresh lesson in the power of disinformation to see decent, patriotic Chinese sharing tales of the cia paying gullible Hong Kongers to join marches or smuggling in foreign rioters on late-night flights (a rumour sourced to a driver at Hong Kong airport, in the version that Chaguan heard).
There is something positively alarming about signs that, at some level, Communist Party bosses believe the black-hands story. Neither evidence nor common sense supports the tale's central charge that outsiders tricked or provoked as many as 2m Hong Kongers into joining marches. The accusations began while the protesters were still overwhelmingly peaceful, focused on a planned law that would send suspects from their city's Westernstyle justice system into Communist-controlled mainland courts. To propagandists in Beijing, no free will has been marshalling those students and pensioners, doctors in hospital scrubs and black-suited lawyers, off-duty civil servants and parents with pushchairs. Instead the protesters are at best dupes, and at worst foreigner-loving race traitors, ashamed of being Chinese.
The drumbeat has intensified as the demonstrations have grown more violent. Police and at least one mainland reporter have endured beatings by young radicals gripped by nihilistic rage. To objective analysts, the causes include protesters' paranoia after days of police infiltration and brutality, and the lack of any further concessions by the government as rewards for pragmatism other than the shelving of the extradition bill. But grim-faced government spokesmen in Hong Kong and Beijing have another explanation. They accuse foreign forces, meaning America, of fomenting a Ukraine-style "colour revolution" to keep a rising China down.
In late July Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate and Hong Kong's first chief executive under Chinese rule, called the "well-organised" protests evidence of "masterminds behind the storm", with "various signs" pointing to America and Taiwan. Communist-controlled newspapers have made much of the handful of protesters who insist on carrying American and colonial-era Hong Kong flags on marches (which is arguably more foolish than sinister). They have shared images of a "foreign commander" directing protests by smartphone, who turned out to be a New York Times journalist texting colleagues. They have also published photographs of a meeting between pro-democracy leaders and Julie Eadeh, a diplomat at America's consulate whose job is to talk to local politicians. One such newspaper, Takungpao, called Ms Eadeh "a person of mysterious status and an expert in low-key acts of subversion". Given that Ms Eadeh met Hong Kong's most famous democracy activists in a hotel lobby in broad daylight, either the tradecraft of American super-spies is slipping, or the party's media define the term "mysterious" pretty loosely.
Those accusing America of funding revolution in Hong Kong must also grapple with some logical objections. For one thing, the protests do not need much funding. Ordinary Hong Kongers have donated spare T-shirts to replace clothes soaked in pepper spray, and money to buy hard hats, face masks and McDonald's vouchers for hungry youngsters. For another, stability and the status quo in Hong Kong serve American interests profitably and well. More American businesses operate in Hong Kong today than in 1997, when British colonial rule ended. Some of America's largest corporations rely on the city's open markets, transparent legal system, uncensored internet, modern transport links and businessfriendly governance as they access China's vast markets. It is true that congressional leaders have urged rulers in Beijing to avoid sending in troops to crush protests, and that senior American officials have recently hosted pro-democracy Hong Kongers. But America's long-standing policy has been to lobby China to preserve the territory's freedoms, not to seek a democratic revolution. As for President Donald Trump, he has dubbed the protests "riots"-the term used by Chinese officials-and said he has "ZERO doubt" that China's leader, Xi Jinping, can "humanely solve the Hong Kong problem."
The world seen from Beijing: greedy, hypocritical and cruel
There are reasons why propagandists peddle the black-hands myth. For one thing, it works. After initially censoring news from Hong Kong, official outlets are full of videos showing protesters attacking police or hurling petrol bombs, over captions calling them splittists who want formal independence from China (in reality, a fringe position in Hong Kong). Many ordinary folk have heard little about the extradition law that sparked the protests. Chinese opinion is hardly monolithic, but it is not hard to find netizens impatient to see snooty, ungrateful Hong Kongers crushed.
Most worrying, China's rulers are betraying a bleak and cynical worldview in which might is right and the big always dominate the small. To them, it is not conceivable that 7.3m Hong Kongers could believe that their individual, universal rights trump the will of 1.4.bn compatriots. If tiny Hong Kong is defying its mighty Motherland, another great power must be egging it on.
When the British government defends Hong Kong's freedoms, Chinese officials are sure that Britain is still sulking about its loss of empire-and will pipe down once Brexit renders it friendless. Other Western envoys in Beijing have been lectured that their support for Hong Kong must be part of a concerted push by American hawks to hurt China. Suggest that Western countries might occasionally be guided by principle and Chinese officials scoff.
Their cynicism is self-serving, of course, as it handily shifts blame for the mistrust the party inspires in Hong Kong. But it also clouds China's vision of the world at a perilous moment. Some propaganda is laughable and tragic at the same time.

摘要: After 30 years spent largely shunning publicity, Huawei has turned into one of the world's chattier high-technology firms, inviting journalists into once-secret research laboratories and smartphone assembly lines. The reasons for all this choreographed openness are straightforward. Huawei, whose worldwide revenues exceeded 720 billion yuan in 2018, stands accused by Trump administration officials and members of Congress of being variously owned, subsidized or at least controlled by the Chinese state, with notably close links to the army and intelligence services. American officials accuse Huawei of stealing technology from American and other foreign rivals. They scoff at claims that the firm is owned by its own employees in a benign sort of shareholding co-operative, and that its Communist Party committee is tasked with nothing more sinister than staff training and welfare. In May Huawei's reputation landed it on the American Commerce Department's "entity list" of firms that may threaten national security. Here, Huawei's solutions to the problem of high-tech globalization in a low-trust age are discussed.

全文文献: Headnote Huawei is trying to solve a hard problem: how to sell sensitive tech in the absence of trust
ON BALANCE, it seems implausible that a committee-let alone a committee run by grey-suited Communist Party commissars-could design anything as odd as the new research campus of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Comprising 12 replica European "towns" spread across lush subtropical hills near the southern city of Dongguan, the campus houses 18,000 scientists, designers and other boffins in turreted German castles, Spanish mansions and Italian palazzi, connected by an antique-style red train. Staff canteens include Illy espresso bars and French bistros. A herd of bronze rhinoceroses grazes by the river that divides faux Verona from ersatz Heidelberg. It is not hard to see why the campus is a stop on tours that Huawei has started offering to foreign journalists in recent months. Impressive, mad and a bit tacky, the research campus is a suggestive bit of evidence. Perhaps Huawei may just be what it claims to be, at least when it comes to decisions about architecture: a privately held company guided by the ambitions and quirks of its billionaire founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former military engineer and Europhile history buff.
After 30 years spent largely shunning publicity, Huawei has turned into one of the world's chattier high-technology firms, inviting journalists into once-secret research laboratories and smartphone assembly lines. The reasons for all this choreographed openness are straightforward. Huawei, whose worldwide revenues exceeded 720bn yuan ($i02bn) in 2018, stands accused by Trump administration officials and members of Congress of being variously owned, subsidised or at least controlled by the Chinese state, with notably close links to the army and intelligence services. American officials accuse Huawei of stealing technology from American and other foreign rivals. They scoff at claims that the firm is owned by its own employees in a benign sort of shareholding co-operative, and that its Communist Party committee is tasked with nothing more sinister than staff training and welfare. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has spent months touring the globe, urging allies not to allow Huawei to help build their 5G mobile telecommunications networks, with mixed success. In May Huawei's reputation landed it on the American Commerce Department's "entity list" of firms that may threaten national security.
Step back a bit, and the company's woes are an early sighting of a conundrum with no easy solution. Technological advances are expanding the list of products and services that require a lifelong commitment of trust between clients and suppliers, from chips that keep aeroplanes aloft, to devices that control electrical power grids. At the same time, globalisation has built supply chains linking countries that do not much like each other. The problem is acute when those chains connect America, a country used to setting its own technical and security standards, to China, an uneasy mix of trade partner, commercial competitor and ideological rival.
Broadly speaking, when Chaguan visited the firm's headquarters this week, senior Huawei officers advanced two different solutions to the problem of high-tech globalisation in a low-trust age. Only one of those solutions is very persuasive.
That persuasive idea is to treat distrust in global supply chains as a technical challenge, rather than a political one. In this model, distrust can never be eliminated but may be mitigated. A Huawei executive with experience in African and European markets, where the firm's products are seen as robust and cheap, draws an analogy with the "ABC" approach to cyber-security, meaning: "Assume nothing. Believe nobody. Check everything." Huawei highups praise Britain and other European countries for applying a risk-management approach to the task of building such infrastructure as wireless networks, involving common standards for security and transparency with which all companies are invited to comply, and lots of third-party verification. The organising principle is that no product should be either trusted or distrusted unconditionally, simply on the basis of its country of origin.
Huawei's second, unpersuasive solution involves trying to convince outsiders that, given the right written and verbal assurances from the state, firms from China can, as it happens, be trusted not to help Chinese spies steal secrets. Thus Huawei bosses note assurances from the Chinese foreign ministry that no law exists that could make Chinese firms install backdoors in digital devices, for spies to use. Asked about national-security laws requiring firms to assist Chinese intelligence services, they retort that such laws do not apply outside China's borders. A company executive grumbles that Western sceptics seem to doubt that China is run according to the rule of law. At times, a cultural gap in perceptions is detectable. Huawei veterans recall their firm's early years, when state-owned enterprises bullied private businesses, and on occasion lobbied government officials to deny Huawei the right to seek overseas business. China is so much more open now, such veterans say, lamenting that outsiders cannot see this, or prefer to focus on remaining differences with the West.
What Huawei should say, but cannot
Alas, it is not credible to claim that promises or laws bind the Communist Party and its security apparatus. The party explicitly claims "absolute leadership" over courts, calling judicial independence a Western error. Then there is the exceptional size of China's visible machinery of repression and surveillance. Given that security services in every country tend to be like icebergs, with still-larger hidden parts, it is reasonable to be exceptionally wary of China's.
A more convincing approach would see Huawei admit that China is different and concede that some party commands cannot be defied. That agreed, Huawei could then focus on making high-tech products and systems designed for use in a world of low or non-existent trust. Huawei bosses cannot make that argument, because party leaders would be incensed. Those turreted castles are impressive. But outside those manicured grounds is China.

摘要: Revealingly often, when foreigners meet Chinese leaders the encounter is a pain in the neck. The cause is not mysterious. For reasons that may involve both high culture and low political calculation, important visitors to China are typically invited to sink into one of a pair of side-by-side armchairs, at one end of a formal reception room. There the guest must sit, head twisted through 90 degrees, to see and hear a host whose opening remarks may stretch to an hour. Foreign bigwigs planning to consult aides in such a meeting room are further out of luck. Their entourage will be trapped in their own armchairs, placed in a horseshoe pattern or marching down one long wall of the room, opposite a matching row of Chinese officials. It says something sobering about present-day China that sales of the armchairs used in horseshoe-shaped meeting rooms have risen steadily over the past 20 years.

全文文献: Headnote Why China is so fond of useless meetings in over-stuffed chairs
REVEALINGLY OFTEN, when foreigners meet Chinese leaders the encounter is a pain in the neck. The cause is not mysterious. For reasons that may involve both high culture and low political calculation, important visitors to China are typically invited to sink into one of a pair of side-by-side armchairs, at one end of a formal reception room. There the guest must sit, head twisted through 90 degrees, to see and hear a host whose opening remarks may stretch to an hour.
Foreign bigwigs planning to consult aides in such a meeting room are further out of luck. Their entourage will be trapped in their own armchairs, placed in a horseshoe pattern or marching down one long wall of the room, opposite a matching row of Chinese officials. In a recent episode of the us-China Dialogue Podcast, an oral history project at Georgetown University, Wendy Cutler, who as an American official played a leading role in negotiating China's entry to the World Trade Organisation, recalls how her Chinese counterparts used exhaustion and embarrassment to manipulate visitors. For one thing, they have a habit of beginning meetings with envoys at 10pm. Then there is the hazard of reception rooms that make it daunting to stand up from an armchair, cross yards of empty carpet and hand a boss a note about a detail of policy or tactics. Visitors have to be very sure that their message for the boss is worth the interruption, because the room makes it "very awkward", Ms Cutler recalls.
Such recollections lead Chaguan to what may seem an odd hunch. This is a moment of low trust in China's relations with the world, when many Western governments and businesses are losing hope that China's leaders will open their markets to foreigners on equal terms. This is also a moment of impatience, when Chinese practices that have long frustrated outsiders, such as state subsidies for national champions, or the use of security laws and politicised regulations to bully trade secrets out of foreign firms, feel insupportable now that China is so large. To emerge safely from these perilous times China and America, in particular, will have to learn to co-exist as competitors, trade partners and ideological rivals, at one and the same time. One way to guess whether such a rebalancing is possible is to watch the chairs.
Whenever Chinese, American or other foreign delegations meet, if the two sides are sitting at a long table that allows for substantive, clause-by-clause negotiations, flickers of optimism may be justified. If, instead, meeting rooms feature antimacassars on overstuffed armchairs, little tables bearing teacups and large paintings of mist-shrouded mountains, gloom may be in order.
It says something sobering about present-day China that sales of the armchairs used in horseshoe-shaped meeting rooms have risen steadily over the past 20 years. Surprisingly often, the armchairs used for such meetings are made by a single company, Tiantan (or Temple of Heaven) Furniture, founded in 1956 and owned by Beijing's city government. Business is good, says the firm.
The company traces the chairs' history back to imperial audiences granted during the Song Dynasty, almost a thousand years ago, when floor-mats and stools gave way to chairs. Running at up to $800 each, Tiantan's bestseller is known within the company as the "Jiang-style Armchair", because it was commissioned in the early 2000s by aides to the party leader and president of the day, Jiang Zemin. Patriotism has helped expand the market for all sorts of traditional Chinese furniture, says Wang Shengli, a manager at Tiantan. In contrast: "In the 1980s, Western styles were more popular." Beyond that, there is the specific appeal of owning chairs fit for a vice-minister or provincial party secretary. Tiantan sells a lot to the government, but also to private businesses, hotels and wealthy individuals moved to imitate the look of Communist officials, in what Mr Wang calls a "follow-the-leaders" effect.
It takes 20 days to assemble a Jiang-style armchair from Chinese walnut, fine cloth or leather (red is the most popular colour) and lots of foam padding, especially in the small of the back, so that occupants can sit up straight for hours. "The chair is quite firm, as is fitting for a leader," explains Mr Wang on a factory tour, over the noise of whirring tools. Tiantan armchairs are found in the Great Hall of the People and the central leadership compound of Zhongnanhai in Beijing, and even aboard leaders' aeroplanes.
Naturally, if China does agree to businesslike meetings, America has homework to do, too. From 2004 to 2013 David Dollar represented first the World Bank and then the United States Treasury in Beijing. At too many meetings he watched American political appointees, flanked by young aides straight out of graduate school, as they tried to negotiate with the help of written records of talks involving previous administrations. Meanwhile, in the chair of honour on the Chinese side, Mr Dollar says, the chief negotiator quite possibly "used to be at the bottom of the table 20 years ago, and then they sent him off to be vice-mayor of Guiyang or whatever, and he works his way up." As a result, Chinese officials could and did cite oral agreements that they believed they had heard American officials make years earlier. In contrast, laments Mr Dollar, "The us has no institutional memory."
Striving for a meeting of minds
Just now America presents China with a particular puzzle. President Donald Trump revels in pomp, protocol and monarchical chats with fellow leaders, which should play into China's hands. At his first meeting with President Xi Jinping he happily shared a brocade sofa at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, and declared his Chinese guest a great friend. But Mr Trump also feels unbound by agreements, oral or otherwise, made by previous governments, a blow to China and its elephantine capacity for remembering ancient half-promises. With globalisation in the balance, it is time China stopped using the dismal horseshoe to stall reforms. But America, too, must make better use of its seat at trade's top table.

全文文献: Headnote Team Trump is losing a messaging war about the fate of Chinese students in America
DIZZIED BY TRUMPIAN flip-flops and clashing policy announcements, China's ruling classes no longer know quite what to expect from America-with one exception. Chinese elites appear sure that President Donald Trump's America is willing to hurt their children, as part of a racist scheme to keep China down.
Outsiders might think it odd to spend time fretting about the roughly 360,000 Chinese youngsters studying in America, and whether they face tougher visa rules or unfair scrutiny from FBI agents hunting spies on college campuses. After all, tariffs worth billions of dollars are at stake in the trade war. Depending on what Mr Trump's dealmaking gut tells him, America may or may not be bent on crushing Huawei, the telecommunications giant key to China's hopes of becoming a technological superpower.
Yet when Chinese officials meet Westerners, America's treatment of Chinese students and scholars comes up time and again. For many, the issue is personal: in China as elsewhere, few things matter more to the elite than getting their offspring into Stanford. Chaguan spent July 8th and 9 th at the World Peace Forum, a conference attended by Chinese leaders and foreign grandees, hosted by Tsinghua University in Beijing. In public debates and in private corridor conversations, Americans were repeatedly scolded by Chinese government ministers, professors and retired generals, and even ambassadors from Western allies. The charge is that, in the name of national security, America is treating Chinese students and scholars as a new "Yellow Peril", in a witch-hunt worthy of Senator Joseph McCarthy.
In part, this is a useful propaganda line. Chinese state media have been cranking out America-bashing commentaries ever since trade talks broke down in May. It is especially potent to point out ways in which rich-but-flawed, crime-ridden America is not safe for Chinese youngsters. A hit television drama this summer, "Over The Sea I Come To You", depicts Chinese parents who accompany children studying in a rather bleak America. In one episode a Chinese father saves his son from a school shooting, heroically dodging a bullet then punching the gunman to the ground before an American swat team eventually arrives.
Such horrors aside, it turns out to be just as potent to argue that Chinese students are being singled out for discrimination by American authorities, as part of a vindictive campaign by an ageing superpower to hold China back. The vice foreign minister, Le Yucheng, gave a speech at the peace forum arguing that America's many problems, from the bitter legacy of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, to yawning inequality and crumbling infrastructure, should not be blamed on China's rise. After the speech, the first question to the minister came from a professor, lamenting visa delays for "our students" who hold offers from American universities, as well as cases in which Chinese scholars had seen ten-year American visas cancelled. Mr Le was sympathetic. China sends teenagers to study in America without worrying if they will be brainwashed, and then they are treated as spies, the minister tut-tutted. Chinese scholars have been harassed in airports and hotels by American intelligence, and, he asserted, cancer researchers have lost jobs at American institutions because of their Chinese ethnicity. How can America be so lacking in confidence? These actions are based on "blood lineage and race", Mr Le charged. Chinese people find this "hard to understand".
In vain American participants at the forum noted that Western scholars in China have endured harsh visa restrictions for years. Chinese universities face ever-tougher state surveillance. It is not unreasonable to charge Communist Party bosses with hypocrisy for clamping down on academic debate at home, while the past four Chinese leaders all sent a child to study in America (President Xi Jinping's daughter was at Harvard).
Still, it is a wrinkle of the human condition that hypocrisy and sincere indignation can co-exist in the same breast. Since the first Chinese students attended Yale and other universities in the 19th century, an American education has stood for critical thinking, an escape from rote learning and freedoms that are both invigorating and alarming. The desire to give Chinese youngsters a horizonbroadening education unites flintily ideological officials and aspirational middle-class Chinese who care nothing for politics.
The key to their angst-and to this tense moment in ChineseAmerican relations-lies in a particular sense that just as China is poised to join the world on an equal footing, giving its young chances of which their elders could only dream, a selfish, resentful America is slamming shut its doors.
If young Chinese are welcome, say so
America's government has done little to explain its side. Visa policies are always rather secretive. There seems little doubt that America's rules have become tougher for Chinese applicants, notably in science subjects, with more students languishing in "additional administrative processing" for so long that some must abandon their studies. FBI chiefs have repeatedly briefed Congress about how China uses scholars to steal secrets. It would not hurt the FBI director to invite Chinese students to a speech to explain how much espionage actually goes on in America, state that the vast majority of Chinese are not under suspicion, then take lots of questions. Chinese censors might keep news of such a speech from parents and youngsters back home. (No speakers at the peace forum either knew or were willing to acknowledge that Mr Trump recently praised Chinese students as "tremendous assets".)
America has a story worth telling. It is one about open societies, and how openness to people and ideas, though it can be seen as a vulnerability, represents their greatest strength. That America is losing a propaganda war, unbeknown to most Americans, is an extraordinary failure. Some day, China's brightest youngsters may no longer want to come.

全文文献: Headnote China's maritime expansion reflects a curious mix of ambition and paranoia about being contained
GEOGRAPHICAL GOOD luck gave Wu Zhaozong a front-row seat as China opened to the world. As a boy he watched his grandfather steer a horse-drawn cart through the docks of Tianjin, on China's northern coast. Poor neighbours, living in courtyard homes shared with four families, would follow carts to pick up horse dung and fallen coal-lumps for fuel. Coal was a Tianjin export, as was garlic for Japan. "I very rarely saw cars," Mr Wu recalls.
Today Tianjin is one of the world's ten busiest ports, and Mr Wu is operations director of a ship-supply company. The firm's work includes securing giant wind turbines on ships bound for Chinese partners in Africa. Earlier this week Mr Wu gave Chaguan a lift in his BMW to Tianjin's passenger terminal. There he oversaw crisply uniformed Filipino sailors loading fresh produce onto a cruise ship, before it carried newly affluent Chinese tourists to Japan. The changes witnessed by Mr Wu-driven by Tianjin's location as a gateway to Beijing and other northern cities-have been both dramatic and astonishingly rapid. For Mr Wu, an amiable father of two little girls, is just 38 years old.
China was an inward-looking, continental power when Mr Wu was born. It rose in part by turning to the sea. Seven of the world's ten largest container ports are in China. Overseas, Chinese companies had by 2018 helped build or expand 42 ports in 34 countries, often as part of the Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure scheme. Chinese operators own majority stakes in foreign ports from Abu Dhabi to Zeebrugge.
Unusually in its long history, China faces no serious threat of invasion by land. Against that, its national wealth is concentrated in regions near the sea, as never before. Coastal provinces and cities account for a small fraction of its landmass, but more than half of its GDP. Unsurprisingly, China is striving to become a maritime great power. Its navy, now the largest in Asia, is tasked with defending all that coastal wealth, but also with protecting shipping lanes that carry 85% of the country's trade in goods by volume, as well as vital energy imports. Naval might backs up territorial claims that include the island of Taiwan and almost the whole of the South China Sea. A final naval mission involves denying American warships risk-free access to seas within the "first island chain", the archipelago that encircles China's coastline, comprising Japan and its southern islands, Taiwan and the Philippines.
Not so long ago China called America imperialist for operating foreign military bases. In 2017 China opened an overseas naval base of its own, in the African country of Djibouti. Ostensibly commercial Chinese investments in ports around the Indian Ocean or the South Pacific now routinely trigger sharp questions from America, Australia and other Western powers with Pacific security interests, asking whether another Chinese base is about to open. In late June a senior Pentagon official wrote to Cambodia's government to express concern that Chinese military assets might soon be welcomed at the Ream naval base, the country's largest. Cambodia denies such plans, though it is awash with Chinese money.
Many ordinary Chinese insist that China's only fault is to grow large enough to frighten the West. "We're not and, in our history, have never been an aggressive country," says Mr Wu in Tianjin, loyally, though he is sure that China will defend itself if attacked.
Hawkish Americans scoff at such assurances, which they often hear from Chinese leaders. They point to such acts as China's construction of airbases and missile batteries on disputed reefs in the South China Sea and see aggression and swaggering confidence.
Chinese strategists urge Westerners to understand that their country's maritime rise is also guided by deep insecurity. They call China not so much blessed by geography, as cursed. They have a point. In "Red Star over the Pacific", an influential book on China's maritime ambitions, Toshi Yoshihara and James Holmes, two naval scholars, note that President Dwight Eisenhower saw the first island chain as a means for America and allies to hem China in, a view shared by Chinese admirals. The book quotes a Chinese military strategist who calls Taiwan, at the chain's centre, "a lock around the neck of a great dragon". It describes the claustrophobia of Chinese planners when they contemplate paths to the ocean that run through narrow choke-points between South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, or through the Strait of Malacca near Singapore. China has 14 land neighbours. America is envied for having two, friendly ones, and vast oceans to each side.
America's geography is even luckier below the waves, argues Owen Cote of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a new study in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Since the cold war, he writes, America has successfully tracked foreign submarines with acoustic arrays placed where continental shelves end and deep oceans begin. Asian allies host American arrays to detect Chinese submarines heading for the ocean past Japan, Taiwan or the Philippines. Geographical constraints-such as the shallowness of Chinese inner seas-make it hard for China to build similar arrays.
Ties that bind
Hu Bo, a prominent naval strategist at Peking University, suggests that China may need perhaps two more overseas military bases between Djibouti and the South China Sea, because Djibouti would be too far from home "once we are in an emergency, say on the brink of war". Whereas America gained many bases by fighting world wars, China must seek bases through discreet negotiations. Some might be primarily commercial in peacetime, he suggests. Increasingly, China has "huge interests overseas". That offers avenues for co-operation with other countries, but also vulnerabilities. Mr Hu says it would be a "suicide mission" for China to take any actions that might provoke a blockade in its near seas-whether by America or other sea-powers. That is an oddly reassuring argument, at least for the rest of the world. In geopolitics, if not geography, a sense of vulnerability can be a stroke of luck.

摘要: Whether they admit it or not, protesters in Hong Kong are challenging Xi Jinping's authority. Activists say that their goals and those of party chiefs in Beijing should be nicely aligned: both camps seek continued prosperity for Hong Kong, 22 years after the former British colony became a free market enclave in China, under the slogan "one country, two systems". Over a coffee grabbed between protests, Nathan Law, a leader in Hong Kong's democracy movement, concedes that when activists demand a freely elected, democratic government, they are, logically, defying Hong Kong's ultimate rulers in Beijing, who have interpreted Hong Kong's law to require loyalty tests for candidates for public office. Western governments face a dilemma. They feel obliged to speak out on the extradition bill, amid cries of alarm from businesses in Hong Kong.

全文文献: Headnote Whether they admit it or not, protesters in Hong Kong are challenging Xi Jinping's authority
STRIKINGLY OFTEN, campaigners for Western-style freedoms in Hong Kong pretend that they are not seeking a fight with the Communist Party of China. Rather, activists say that their goals and those of party chiefs in Beijing should be nicely aligned: both camps seek continued prosperity for Hong Kong, 22 years after the former British colony became a free-market enclave in China, under the slogan "one country, two systems". Instead, the campaigners sound crossest with Hong Kong's government, for failing to maintain a strict enough separation from the mainland.
Campaigners have mostly held to that don't-poke-the-Chinesedragon stance during protests that have snarled central Hong Kong since June 9th. Two of the demonstrations have involved more than a million people demanding the withdrawal of a bill that would allow extraditions from the city to mainland China. At times, the contradictions have been a little dizzying. Some protesters defied baton-swinging police and tear-gas as they denounced the Hong Kong government-and above all its chief executive Carrie Lam-for exposing them to a Chinese justice system in which they have no confidence. Marchers waved blood-red banners adorned with images of handcuffs. They yelled obscene Cantonese insults aimed at Mrs Lam, at police officers and (Chaguan regrets to report) at the mothers of those officers. Protest signs depicted Mrs Lam as Gollum, a small and malevolent hobbit. But slogans targeting Xi Jinping, China's leader, have been rare.
Over a coffee grabbed between protests, Nathan Law, a leader in Hong Kong's democracy movement, concedes that when activists demand a freely elected, democratic government, they are, logically, defying Hong Kong's ultimate rulers in Beijing, who have interpreted Hong Kong's law to require loyalty tests for candidates for public office. But defying the central leadership is not the activists' primary objective, he says: "All our demands are directed to the Hong Kong government."
These are vertiginous times for campaigners like Mr Law, who at the age of 25 has already been elected to Hong Kong's Legislative Council (only to be expelled for incorrectly reciting his oath of office) and served jail time for his role in pro-democracy protests in 2014. After Mrs Lam suspended the extradition bill, some foreign media called her climb-down one of the biggest political setbacks that Mr Xi has faced in his years as China's leader. It feels very different to protesters, says Mr Law, as chanting comrades walk past. Activists want Mrs Lam to withdraw the bill entirely. They also want a committee to investigate heavy-handed policing, and an agreement not to prosecute marchers accused of assaulting police officers and other lawbreaking. To date, Mrs Lam has not budged. "Actually, we haven't gained anything," says Mr Law.
He has a message for the central government: that "keeping Hong Kong as a very vibrant and very competitive city is good for both of us". But in the short term he sounds more concerned by local opinion, guided by a lesson from the protests of 2014, that "we have to keep the public onside". He stresses small acts of restraint by the leaderless, digitally mobilised movement. He cites a new tactic of surrounding government offices during the day, rather than blocking roads first thing, so that civil servants can get to work but may (he hopes to their delight) be sent home early.
Rank-and-file protesters are also focused on local politics. Wayne, a 20-year-old student blockading the city's main tax offices, shrugs when asked about his chances of being heeded by Mr Xi. "He is a king," he says. His grievances are with Hong Kong officials for failing to keep the rest of China at a sufficient distance. Grumbling about "our money" being taken to build new connections to the mainland by rail and bridge, Wayne says-inaccurately-that under one country, two systems, which runs until 2047, Hong Kong is "not China, not yet".
Such talk would enrage most mainland Chinese-if strict censorship were ever to let them hear from Hong Kong's protesters directly. It certainly appals central government officials, who play an ever-more visible role in Hong Kong's politics.
Regina Ip, a prominent pro-establishment politician in Hong Kong, says the territory is unhappy. She blames economic mismanagement, including a housing crisis and a failure to seize the opportunities offered by a rising China. She also blames meddling by foreign powers. "My own conspiracy theory is there are people trying to manufacture June 4th crises in Hong Kong," she says darkly, referring to the date of the bloody end of the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Mrs Ip credits the central authorities with wisdom and pragmatism. But she fears that Hong Kong's "weakened" government will now "lie low", avoiding contentious bills.
Self-interest, yes, enlightenment, no
Western governments face a dilemma. They feel obliged to speak out on the extradition bill, amid cries of alarm from businesses in Hong Kong. But when democracy activists petition Western consulates in Hong Kong, as hundreds of them did on June 26th, it prompts the central government to weigh in, and fuels Chinese propaganda. The West's strongest argument is an appeal to enlightened self-interest. Western leaders urge Mr Xi to see the harm that his party's clumsy actions could do to Hong Kong, a valuable place. Alas, each year brings more evidence that Mr Xi sees things the other way round. He worries about what troublesome places like Hong Kong might do to the Communist Party.
After previous mass protests in Hong Kong, the central government staged tactical retreats. It allowed the territory to drop contentious laws, then quietly tightened its grip. The party stepped up funding for loyalists to run for local office. It leant on businessmen to support government plans. Tame tycoons bought up media outlets. Political veterans expect more such efforts. Hence the pro-democracy camp's caution. Its members may fear confronting Mr Xi. He does not fear confronting them.

全文文献: Headnote A fly-on-the-wall account of what China tells visiting American bigwigs
A BIT LATE, China's leaders are starting to accept that their trade war with President Donald Trump is only one element of a larger crisis in relations with America-and not the most dangerous one. The leaders understand that their critics within America's foreign-policy and national-security machine-meaning aides to Mr Trump, members of both parties in Congress and officers in the State Department, Pentagon, spy agencies and beyond-want China to change its ways. They also believe (or hope) that Mr Trump wants something different, and perhaps less painful for them: to show voters the spectacle of China losing a trade fight with him.
China's rulers now accept that they face more than a Trump problem. They concede that bipartisan suspicion of China in America will intensify in the run-up to the elections of November 2020, and will continue afterwards, whoever wins. They absorbed that message during visits by high-ranking Americans, including Mr Trump's officials, business bosses and veterans of Republican and Democratic governments. Dismayingly, they show no sign of accepting that China's own actions are in any way to blame.
Chinese leaders believe that America's policy machine wants them to change principles that have guided China's rise for 20 years. They protest that these demands cut to the heart of China's model of development. They are not entirely wrong. Such figures as the United States Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, have drawn up a charge sheet of Chinese norms and practices deemed intolerable now that China is so large, and so competitive in so many fields. Mr Lighthizer has allies in Congress, from both parties. They want China to abandon its model of state capitalism, with its subsidies for local champions, arm-twisting transfers of technology, curbs on market access and politicised regulation. Mr Lighthizer has proposed enforcement and verification mechanisms that Chinese figures indignantly compare to the inspections that underpinned cold-war arms-control agreements. No Chinese leader, it is said, could accept such a humiliation-any more than they will tolerate American moves to strangle Huawei, a telecommunications giant that is central to China's plans to become a standard-setting tech superpower.
There is much Chinese grumbling about security hawks working for Mr Trump, from his national security adviser, John Bolton, to military commanders. The hawks are accused of breaking understandings about support for Taiwan, the democratic island that China claims as its own. The Chinese side thinks that Mr Trump was bullied by hawks into walking out on North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, at their summit in Hanoi in February. It is no accident that China's president, Xi Jinping, decided to pay a state visit to North Korea, shortly before attending a G20 summit in Japan which Mr Trump will also join. Chinese officials gasped when Mr Trump threatened to slap extra tariffs on China if Mr Xi did not agree to meet him on the G20's sidelines. Japan's prime minister might swallow an American insult like that, growl Chinese sources, but not us. By visiting Pyongyang first (he arrived on June 20th), Mr Xi reminded Mr Trump that China's leader is an indispensable diplomatic actor, not a junior partner in a trade dispute.
Chinese policy types obsess over the idea that Team Trump is not engaged in a sincere negotiation, but is seeking to contain a rising China. They complain about shifting American demands. At first China was told that the problem was the trade balance, and offered to buy American goods. Then economic rules and norms were called the crux of the dispute. So China prepared to negotiate, drawing up a 150-page draft agreement. Then, as the Chinese side tells it, Mr Xi realised that America's plan amounted to an assault on Chinese sovereignty, rejected it and has since been cheered within his own system for his stand. There is muttering, in contrast, about Mr Xi's chief economic aide and trade envoy, Liu He. Mr Liu, a deputy prime minister, is accused of lacking political sense.
Mr Trump is not a leader in thrall to principles. That is why the Chinese side hopes, in essence, that he could accept a trade deal which breaks Mr Lighthizer's heart, and a North Korean pact that leaves Mr Bolton miserable, as long as those deals bring him applause from voters. Mr Xi, it is said, believes that Mr Trump does not want to decouple America's economy from China's-except in the production of some sensitive technology. But Mr Xi does worry that America's president could be hijacked by hardline advisers. If no reasonable deal can be struck, Chinese hosts tell Americans, Mr Xi will wait for the election in November 2020 to produce a different president. They express confidence that relief will come sooner, because Mr Trump needs votes from farm states hurt by the tariff wars, and is desperate to keep the stockmarket roaring.
Imperialists never change
Doubts lurk amid the bluster. In public Chinese officials say that Mr Trump needs a deal to win in 2020. In private they ask whether, perhaps, American voters might prefer to see him fight on. They admit to bafflement over some of Mr Trump's sallies, such as when he told Fox News that he could not accept a "50-50 deal" with China, but had to come out ahead. To Chinese ears, that was fantastically unhelpful. It recalled the "unequal treaties" imposed by 19thcentury powers which every Chinese schoolchild is taught to hate. Mr Trump has said that he will not let China become the world's largest economy in his lifetime. Does he mean these things, Chinese hosts ask, or is this all domestic politics?
Doubts have consequences. To prepare Chinese public opinion for a long trade stand-off, propaganda chiefs have abandoned months of restraint and told state media to start thundering about American bullying. Stoking nationalism is a familiar Chinese ploy. But it has real-world effects, too. As China reduces its own room for manoeuvre, it risks forcing Mr Trump to concede ground to China to secure a deal. Meanwhile his chaotic style is straining China's system to its limits. The mood in Beijing is anxious, with reason.

全文文献: Headnote New commercial tribunals dream of rivalling the West's. They are off to a cautious start
Three woRös-Fairness, Professionalism, Convenience-form a mission statement for the China International Commercial Court, which held its first public hearing in Xi'an on May 29th. When Chaguan attended the session, alongside foreign diplomats and representatives of China's Supreme People's Court, that threeword promise in English and Chinese shone from a digital screen dominating the bronze and marble entrance hall of this, China's newest judicial institution.
It is built to impress, for it has large ambitions. It was founded to buttress the railways, roads and fibre-optic cables of the Belt and Road Initiative-a globe-spanning scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping-with something less visible: a distinctively Chinese vision of how laws should govern globalised commerce. The court has two tribunals. The one in Xi'an is in a symbolic spot. The city was the historic terminus for jingling, snorting camel trains on trade routes later dubbed the Silk Road. Its sister tribunal in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen will hear disputes relating to maritime routes of Mr Xi's project. Yet for all the pomp, the new court has an uncertain future, clouded by doubts about how many firms will agree to use it-though its remit now extends to large disputes involving foreign businesses, not just belt-and-road deals. The doubts are related to a fourth word dear to Communist leaders but missing from courthouse digital screens: control.
A desire for this has made officials exceedingly cautious when crafting the court's rules. Other judicial bodies dealing with international commercial cases have opened in recent years from Dubai to Singapore and the Netherlands. To signal their independence, they typically employ judges from several countries. Leading lawyers urged China's supreme court to consider similar bold steps when setting up the new tribunals, playing on its desire to make the judiciary more worldly and better-trained. But officials at China's legislature balked at changing the law to allow foreign judges to sit in the new court. Instead the tribunals will borrow supreme-court judges. Hearings will be conducted in Chinese by Chinese lawyers, though evidence written in English is allowed.
The belt-and-road court is part of the supreme court. It has appointed an "expert committee" with 32, mostly foreign, members. But their role is only to advise the tribunals and to mediate should parties prefer to avoid litigation. A French member, Tao Jingzhou, who heads the China practice of Dechert, a law firm, laments in a new paper that the court is "constrained in many ways".
Shan Wenhua, another of the court's advisers, fielded reporters' questions on opening day in Xi'an. Professor Shan, who is dean of the law school at Xi'an Jiaotong University, assured Chaguan that the court's Chinese judges would "administer justice independently from any interference". He compared the new institution favourably to commercial courts and arbitration tribunals in London or Singapore, noting that it will offer the choice of formal litigation, arbitration or mediation, all under one roof. Answering questions from Chinese state media, the professor went further. Chinese businesses face "great risks" in belt-and-road countries where legal systems are not of "very high" quality, he explained. In addition, having to rely on foreign legal systems is "out of keeping with our status as a major power," he said. "We have a shot at creating a better system."
It is easier to grasp the scale of China's ambitions than to understand what international commercial law with Chinese characteristics might look like. In March the supreme court's president, Zhou Qiang, delivered his annual report to the legislature. Item one was a pledge to uphold the Communist Party's "absolute leadership" over the work of Chinese courts-for China rejects judicial independence, calling it a false Western ideal. Mr Zhou also called for strict implementation of rules requiring judges to seek Communist leaders' instructions when "major matters" arise. Mr Zhou's comments raise questions about the new belt-and-road tribunals, Susan Finder, one of the court's expert advisers, has written on her influential blog, Supreme People's Court Monitor.
Some motives to have more foreign cases heard in mainland China may be relatively benign. For instance, autocratic Chinese business bosses, notably from state-owned enterprises, loathe being cross-examined in foreign commercial courts or arbitration tribunals, and often do badly there. Other possible motives are more worrying. Too many belt-and-road contracts are secretive, unequal and reward local power-brokers in opaque ways, reflecting deep cynicism about global norms. Some experts wonder if China secretly envies the ability of American judges in civil suits to demand the seizure of assets on the other side of the world. Though Chinese officials denounce America as a bully with a long reach, some scholars wonder whether China might one day begin issuing more extraterritorial judgments of its own.
The long arm of the law
International lawyers expect rich-world parties to be wary of the tribunals, for now. They predict that foreign firms will prefer to take disputes involving Chinese partners to such compromise locations as Hong Kong, a Chinese city with its own legal system, complete with foreign judges. The opening case in Xi'an concerned a shareholding dispute involving Red Bull, an energy drink from Thailand. The case was passed to the tribunal by the supreme court. "Where you go to resolve a dispute is more or less a question of your bargaining power," says a lawyer with years of China experience. Smaller firms from poorer nations have fewer choices.
In the law courts of Communist China, power and political control count for more than fairness. The tribunals could one day matter a lot, should they be used to export a vision of international law that reflects that same, bleak worldview. At the moment, an obsession with power and order is hobbling the new tribunals. But that could change: China's autocrats may not be as clumsy for ever. ?

Chaguan: Tiananmen, 30 years on

摘要: Three decades after troops used murderous force to clear protesters from Tiananmen Square and central Beijing, covering up that crime has become a bit of a chore. China's security machine is ready to censor, arrest and imprison those who speak too candidly about events in 1989. But 30 years on this work of repression is carried out with cold, bureaucratic efficiency--a far cry from the terrors of June 3rd and 4th when soldiers and tanks shot and smashed their way into the ceremonial heart of Beijing, as loudspeakers metallically intoned that the army "loves the people". China's leaders want the outside world to believe that they rule in a majoritarian compact accepted by almost all their citizens. They would include in that social contract the grim dystopia that they have built in the far-western region of Xinjiang, where perhaps a million members of the Muslim Uighur minority have been sent to re-education camps and millions more endure unsleeping high-tech surveillance.

全文文献: Headnote What if China's rulers pay no price for the massacre in Beijing?
THREE DECADES after troops used murderous force to clear protesters from Tiananmen Square and central Beijing, covering up that crime has become a bit of a chore. China's security machine is ready to censor, arrest and imprison those who speak too candidly about events in 1989. But 30 years on this work of repression is carried out with cold, bureaucratic efficiency-a far cry from the terrors of June 3rd and 4th when soldiers and tanks shot and smashed their way into the ceremonial heart of Beijing, as loudspeakers metallically intoned that the army "loves the people".
The most recent jailing linked to the Tiananmen protests OCCurred on April 4th this year. A court in the south-western city of Chengdu sentenced an activist, Chen Bing, to three-and-a-half years in prison for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble". His offence: labelling bottles of baijiu alcohol with the iconic image of the lone protester who stared down tanks near the square. That picture, and any other reference to Tiananmen in 1989, is politically taboo in China. Each year, as the anniversary approaches, the relatives of those killed by the army, including the mothers of school pupils gunned down in cold blood, are placed under surveillance or taken on enforced trips out of town.
The cover-up is a headache for internet and social-media companies, which are obliged to employ armies of people to erase banned content. In order for these 20-somethings to be able to spot and delete references to Tiananmen, they must first be taught what happened there, the New York Times reported in January from one "content-reviewing factory".
Such ignorance was once thought impossible. In all, hundreds of people, if not thousands, were killed in Beijing and some in other cities. Tens of thousands, at a minimum, were arrested for involvement in what was declared a "counter-revolutionary riot". Suspects were snatched from homes and workplaces, or off the streets. The protests had drawn students and workers, magistrates in court uniforms and police cadets, and journalists from state media who marched beneath banners reading "We want to print the truth". None was safe. Many endured re-education meetings. The unlucky were jailed. A few, having suffered horrors in prison, were exiled. Millions witnessed these terrors or their aftermath.
Zhao Ziyang, the Communist Party's leader in 1989, was ousted during the unrest for opposing military action. In internal debates Zhao had called the protesters patriotic and endorsed their demands for a more accountable government, tougher anti-corruption measures and the observance of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. He was purged and detained until his death in 2005. In a letter written from house arrest in 1997, he warned that the people would not forget the protests or the party's demonisation of them.
Yet there has been much forgetting, some of it the work of parents who see no good in filling children's heads with politics. It is not hard to imagine the dream of modern party leaders: that all China should forget the passions, fears and dashed hopes of 1989, so that future anniversaries pass without a flicker of dissent. The same party leaders surely hope that foreigners let go of memories of 1989, too. Even as blood was being scrubbed from Beijing streets, Communist officials argued that they had crushed the protests to avoid civil conflict, and to restore party unity so that China could be stable and prosperous. Their argument today, in essence, is that China has succeeded because of that use of force, not despite it.
It frustrates party officials that so many in the West doubt that claim, and suggest that China is weakened to this day by that legacy of violence, paranoia and intolerance of debate. It angers them that foreigners pay such heed to independent-minded people, whether religious believers, feminist campaigners, environmentalists or left-wing students working with unofficial trade unions.
China's leaders want the outside world to believe that they rule in a majoritarian compact accepted by almost all their citizens. They would include in that social contract the grim dystopia that they have built in the far-western region of Xinjiang, where perhaps a million members of the Muslim Uighur minority have been sent to re-education camps and millions more endure unsleeping high-tech surveillance. Party leaders insist that most Chinese approve of this, believing it a price worth paying for eliminating radical Islam and the threat of terrorism.
Communist bosses should be careful what they wish for. Nobody knows how stable their support is because China is so secretive, and because the broad contentment of a country enjoying economic growth is easy to mistake for informed consent. But if a Tiananmen anniversary ever does pass without a flicker of dissent, that would be a dangerous moment, setting up the Chinese nation, and not just its rulers, for a backlash across the democratic world. For the party's swaggering, authoritarian ways are a challenge to the universal values which help to define the West. That is true even though President Donald Trump is a disturbing outlier. He has described the violence in Beijing 30 years ago as a "strong, powerful government" quelling a "riot", albeit with horrible force.
Made reality, the party's dreams would make the world recoil
For sure, foreigners have been guilty of a certain narcissism in imagining that ordinary Chinese, as they grow richer, will aspire to Western freedoms. But dissent in China matters. It allows Western governments to say that their disputes are with China's leaders, not its people. It is because not all Chinese are seen as agents of the party-state that they are welcomed in the West as students and business partners. The party should be grateful that some citizens want a more transparent, accountable government, and distrust propaganda. They should welcome intra-party disagreements that pit reformers against hardliners. They should be glad that the chore of censorship never ends, on June 4th or any day. For a serenely unified, nationalist Chinese autocracy, unequivocally backed by its people, would be a terror to the world.

全文文献: Headnote Chinese leaders think America can be threatened into resuming engagement. That's misguided
There is a lot for Americans to dislike in the Chinese propaganda film "Shangganling". It is based on a real battle in late 1952, during which American and South Korean forces failed to take a mountain ridge from more lightly armed Chinese troops, who suffered terrible casualties. The weeks-long campaign came near the end of the Korean war of 1950-53, which began when the Stalinist regime of Kim Il Sung invaded the pro-American south and which eventually drew in millions of Chinese and un forces. Chinese schools teach that China joined the war in self-defence and was victorious. Pupils are told their countrymen showed solidarity with communist brethren in Korea while standing up to American imperialists who were bent on attacking China's heartland. Official histories avoid the awkward question of who started the "War to Resist America and Aid Korea", as it is known. China's internal estimates put the Chinese death toll at 400,000. The public is told that only 152,000 Chinese were killed.
Newspapers have begun to cite the Korean war in editorials, as they brace the public for prolonged trade conflict with America. Filmed in 1956, "Shangganling" is one of several Korean war films shown on national television in recent days. Sporting crude, prosthetic hooked noses beneath their steel helmets, the "Americans" in that film cackle with laughter as they incinerate Chinese troops with a flame-thrower. In their foxholes they ogle photographs of pin-up girls. They fairly swagger as they advance with support from tanks and bomb-dropping us Air Force jets. But their bullies' bravado vanishes in hand-to-hand combat, depicted in a close-up frenzy of wrestling and stabbing. Soon the Yanks are running away, hands raised in panic, only to meet a murderous American officer, who is shown coldly ordering the fatal machine-gunning of his own troops to frighten the rest back into action.
Perhaps sensing that this Mao-era grotesquery could be misinterpreted, state media have offered guidance. In a tweet, Hu Xijin, editor of Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, argued that victory on Shangganling (Triangle Hill, as Americans called it) had enhanced China's status in its talks with America during the war. "There is no equal negotiation without fighting" is the film's message to Chinese viewers, Mr Hu wrote. A blog, Taoran Notes, which appears to have official backing for its musings on the trade feud, said references to Korea were a way of saying that China is a master of "talking while fighting", including in today's contest with America.
To the Chinese public, the Korean war is an easily grasped symbol, signifying that "even if we go head-to-head with the Americans we should not be afraid. We can take them," says the bestknown Chinese historian of that conflict, Shen Zhihua. He hopes that China's negotiators are signalling toughness to the public in order to leave themselves wriggle room in talks with America.
Mr Shen is an unusually outspoken scholar, whose long research in Chinese, Soviet and Western archives emboldens him to challenge official accounts of the Korean war. He has angered Maoist hardliners by arguing that Stalin cornered Mao into entering the hostilities. The professor says that what the Chinese leader actually wanted was Soviet help to invade Taiwan, the redoubt of the Nationalist regime which was driven to the island at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. In 2017 Mr Shen gave lectures calling today's North Korea, and its nuclear weapons, a liability for China.
Propaganda should not be confused with history, the professor says, drawing deeply on a cigarette in his office at East China Normal University in a suburb of Shanghai. Chinese academics know about the "huge price" that China paid for a war that ended where it started, with Korea divided along the 38th parallel. Early Communist leaders "knew in their hearts" what happened, too. He is less sure that today's still do. As for the general public, they do not know how many died and remember the war simply as a "great success", he sighs. Mr Shen would like to explore hard questions about why talks to halt the Korean war lasted a year-and-a-half, and who benefited from that drawn-out process. Alas, he suspects, such research probably could not be published in China.
Misreading past and present
Foreign historians do not face such constraints. They argue that Mao deliberately prolonged the war by dragging out talks on an armistice that other combatants were ready to declare, notably by stubbornly demanding the return to China of 14,000 Chinese prisoners-of-war who were desperate to be sent to Taiwan. His aim was, in effect, to talk in order to continue fighting (and receiving modern weapons and aid from Stalin), despite warnings from his own military chief about "massive, unnecessary casualties". Mao, unmoved by human suffering, predicted early in the war that 400,000 Chinese would die, and told Stalin that his plan was to spend "several years consuming several hundred thousand American lives". Told about his own son's demise in Korea, Mao murmured only: "In a war, how can there be no deaths?"
China's noisiest patriots, vowing on social media to ditch iPhones for Chinese smartphones, have no idea of the true price their country paid in Korea. They know nothing, for that matter, about why America sought peace talks almost 70 years ago. True, America was daunted by China's willingness to sacrifice lives. In the end, though, America and its allies wanted an armistice because a unified Korea was not an interest worth all-out war, let alone a nuclear one as some hothead generals proposed.
Today, America is debating something unrelated: whether openness to a rising China is sensible and even necessary, or an act of self-harm. War talk and broadcasting xenophobic films is a gift to American hawks who argue that China is an ideological foe that cannot be trusted. In their desperation to assure their own people that they are not a pushover, China's rulers are forgetting the first lesson of propaganda. Real history can be a valuable guide. Falsified history leads countries astray.

全文文献: Headnote America is putting up barriers to reduce the threat from China. It may have the opposite effect
THE HISTORY of attempts to contain modern China is not a happy one. The Soviet Union tried it in 1960 when Mao Zedong's insouciance about nuclear war-he had suggested that such a conflict would kill more imperialists than socialists, leaving the world ruined but Red-alarmed Nikita Khrushchev. Soviet technical advisers, including nuclear-weapons experts who shredded all documents they could not carry, were withdrawn from China. Chinese technicians reassembled the shreds, recovering clues which helped China test an atom bomb four years later.
The lesson was clear. Withdrawing assistance from a threatening China may be rational, but a China that succeeds anyway, and then feels less dependent on outsiders, is not necessarily safer.
It is not a lesson that has much resonance in America today. Whatever happens with the trade war started by President Donald Trump, America is hardening itself against China. Moves are afoot to wall off sensitive technologies behind export controls, tariff barriers and tougher investment-screening rules. With varying degrees of success, American officials are leaning on allies in Europe and elsewhere to shun such Chinese firms as Huawei, a telecommunications giant. Amid allegations of rampant, China-directed espionage on campuses, America is tightening visa rules for Chinese students of science and technology.
In Congress and in the White House, leaders sound unmoved by the downsides of withholding assistance as China rises. If the result is a China that feels that it does not need the West, they are inclined to shrug. "I think that's the way this ends anyway. In essence there is no way that China intends not to eventually wind up at that point," Senator Marco Rubio of Florida recently told Chaguan. The Republican has co-sponsored bipartisan bills that would restrict China's access to American technology and to markets such as telecommunications that touch on national security.
President Xi Jinping sees a test of China's mettle. Protectionism is making it harder to obtain vital technologies from abroad, he declared last September. China must take "the road of self-reliance".
The idea of "self-reliance" has been dear to the Communist Party for 70 years, notes a recent paper by Neil Thomas of the Paulson Institute, a think-tank in Washington. But it has usually referred to a desire for independence, not autarky. The phrase was common under Mao, even during the period when leaders in Moscow sent money, modern machinery and over 10,000 advisers. Deng Xiaoping used the same phrase when he opened China to capitalist forces and foreign investment 40 years ago, Mr Thomas notes. Talking of self-reliance amid so much foreign help sounds contradictory. But the phrase in Chinese is a woolly one, meaning "regeneration through one's own efforts". The barriers that America is now erecting may push China to seek a kind of self-reliance that leads to something dangerous: a China that feels it owes nothing to foreign powers with very different values and rules.
In part, the West's newfound desire to distance itself from China reflects an erosion of the old and complacent belief that free societies have such an edge when it comes to innovation and creativity that they will invariably stay ahead of autocracies. As China catches up, the West is turning defensive.
In part, those advocating a warier approach to China are bowing to an unhappy political logic. Since foreigners first began seeking access to China, back in the days of the Qing emperors, engagement has been seen as a way to strengthen liberals and reformers within the Chinese system. In 19th-century Britain many commentators decried their government's resort to armed force to prise open China's markets, sometimes not so much from a moral standpoint as because they feared that getting tough with China would reinforce its contempt for foreign trade. In 2001, when the World Trade Organisation admitted China as a member, many in the West fondly hoped this gesture would boost the fortunes of reformers battling against state interference in the economy.
Alas, many Americans and other Westerners who work on China policy have little confidence that Chinese reformers wield enough clout to be meaningfully succoured or harmed. Foreign business bosses and politicians believe that Mr Xi's economic aide, Liu He, is a reformer who wants China's markets to be more open. But they see few signs that Mr Liu, who is a deputy prime minister, has any mandate of his own to tackle vested interests opposed to reform. His power comes from representing Mr Xi.
That helps explain why so many foreign governments and businesses quietly applaud an aggressive American approach that a short while ago would have appalled them. In the absence of internal pressure from reformers, they hope that Mr Trump and his team will secure substantive changes in the way China uses subsidies, local monopolies and the coercive transfer of foreign trade secrets to manage its economy. Many of Mr Trump's tactics dismay them, and have at times humiliated Mr Liu, as China's trade envoy. But seeking and empowering allies inside China has not worked.
Losers on every side
This conclusion alarms some of those in China most sympathetic to the West. In Beijing's best-known universities and think-tanks, some scholars urge the world not to walk away. "Right now if you want to talk about reform, domestically, internally, it's difficult," says a think-tank boss, saying that outside pressure "keeps China open". A more hawkish government adviser charges that, if Western governments are too aggressive and distrustful, they "will produce a very terrible nationalism in China."
Darker Chinese forces have much to gain from visible divides with the West. Chinese spies have cause to target foreign trade secrets that are never going to be shared voluntarily. Hardliners can growl that America was always bent on containment, and is now proving it. Both America and China will feel that their actions are rational and make them safer. Both may be proved wrong.

摘要: Insights of Chinese-American actor Celina Horan on the differences between the American and Chinese film markets is presented. Educated in Hong Kong and at the London School of Economics, Horan is fluent in Cantonese, English and Mandarin. The actress would not mourn if Hollywood were to drop projects crafted to appeal to all cultures, and offend in none. She compares the approval process for such films to dipping the same tea bag in ten cups, then drinking from the last. On the Chinese side, she sees studios growing less anxious about foreign success. She says she is proud to work in today's assertive, self-confident China. Unbidden, she pays tribute to one-party rule.

全文文献: Headnote A Chinese-American film star explains why blandly globalised fare flops in China
EVEN IF IT did not boast a character called Captain America, the superhero film "Avengers: Endgame" is a very obviously American spectacle. Beyond its swagger and expensive special effects, the Marvel comic book film series, of which this is the final instalment, celebrates flawed, individualistic superheroes. That the film just broke Chinese box-office records for its opening weekend could lead outsiders to assume that the American and Chinese film markets-the world's two largest-are converging. In fact China's film world is becoming more distinctive and self-confident.
Hollywood producers have bet fair sums of money, over the years, on the idea that American and Chinese audiences are not so very different, and will laugh, weep and cheer at the same, carefully globalised movies. China has a habit of proving them wrong. The "Avengers" series has a large but distinctive set of fans in China, who often say they love the films precisely because they identify with its misfit heroes, struggling with a harsh, judgmental world.
Over 1.7bn cinema tickets were sold in China last year, a domestic record. Most sales were driven by locally made hits in which the stories ranged from Chinese military heroics overseas ("Operation Red Sea") to a bittersweet drama about cancer ("Dying to Survive"). Though Hollywood had a respectable 2018 worldwide, revenues in China for imported films were down year on year.
Before "Avengers: Endgame", the world's most successful film this year had been a Chinese science-fiction epic, "Wandering Earth". But it owed this mainly to its popularity at home. By the end of its American cinema release less than 1% of its revenues came from the American box office. Western reviewers struggled to relate to a film that involved saving the planet, and in which the only speaking role for a non-Chinese was given to a Russian.
Americans flocked to "Crazy Rich Asians", a frothy romantic comedy about Chinese-Americans and Singapore's high society. Despite its supposed crossover appeal, in China it flopped.
Celina Horan, a Chinese-American actor, speaks with authority about the two film markets. Educated in Hong Kong and at the London School of Economics, she is fluent in Cantonese, English and Mandarin. Known professionally as Celina Jade and in China as Lu Jingshan, she played the female lead in "Wolf Warrior 2", released in 2017 and to date the highest-grossing Chinese film ever.
It is a revealing hit. A patriotic action adventure set in war-torn Africa, "Wolf Warrior 2" depicts a lone Chinese commando rescuing Chinese and African hostages from wicked American mercenaries. The film plays on a story often pushed by Communist propaganda officials, namely that China is a growing yet peace-loving military power that-for now-is content to lend its strength to UN peacekeeping missions and other benign tasks. A tense scene shows the hero battling tank-driving baddies on the ground, while awaiting help from a Chinese warship out at sea. Stern Chinese naval officers launch their missiles only after the UN Security Council in New York approves their use of force-a plot device that is hard to spot in Hollywood action flicks. In another scene Ms Jade's character, a Chinese-American doctor, telephones the nearest American consulate for help. She hears an answering-machine, for the Yanks have run away.
Chaguan met Ms Jade in Beijing after her return from a work trip to Los Angeles, as she prepared to visit Norway for a television travel show. Two years ago Hollywood producers sought projects that would work in both America and China, she says. That might involve adding a Chinese actress to an American blockbuster in a "decorative role". Now her American meetings are "all about China". By this she means co-productions using American know-how, but squarely aimed at Chinese audiences.
The actress would not mourn if Hollywood were to drop projects crafted to appeal to all cultures, and offend in none. She compares the approval process for such films to dipping the same tea bag in ten cups, then drinking from the last. On the Chinese side, she sees studios growing less anxious about foreign success: "Why serve the global market when there's so much demand here?"
She is unsurprised when crossover hits struggle. Whereas Ms Jade's American side related to "Crazy Rich Asians", she says her Chinese side found it over the top, and even "fantastical". Chinese audiences like to see romantic heroes showing their love in subtle ways, she says; "It might be how he serves her food."
State planners are playing a role. China opened 9,303 cinema screens last year, says IHS Markit, a consultancy. Government targets are for 80,000 screens nationwide by 2020, up from 60,000 today. Some will struggle amid an oversupply of screens and a shortage of good titles. But expansion has boosted the clout of smaller cities where audiences relish films with local themes.
The propaganda bureau is not amused
Modern China's first big American import, "The Fugitive" starring Harrison Ford, was allowed into just six cities in 1994. It prompted a spat between state film distributors that took on a nationalist edge. One distributor grumbled about "using socialist money to fatten the capitalist pig". Officials still resist Hollywood's charms. A rampant piracy problem is largely resolved. But quotas continue to limit the number of foreign films shown each year (President Donald Trump's trade negotiators are trying to improve Hollywood's market access). Foreign studios pre-emptively pander to China's censors, avoiding taboo subjects like Tibet. The Chinese version of "Bohemian Rhapsody", a biopic about Freddie Mercury, a flamboyant musician, excised most references to his sexuality.
Ms Jade says she is proud to work in today's assertive, self-confident China. Unbidden, she pays tribute to one-party rule. When tackling environmental challenges, "democracy kind of slows things down", she says. Ms Jade questions the idea that censorship makes for bad movies: "Sometimes having limitations forces people to be more creative." She is in the right place.

全文文献: Headnote China throws a revealing party for the 70th anniversary of its maritime forces
AS MILITARY PAGEANTS go, multinational parades of warships deliver quite a complex message. Over a dozen countries- ranging from friends to overt rivals-sent naval vessels to the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao on April 23rd. There they steamed past a destroyer carrying China's commander-in-chief, President Xi Jinping, in honour of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army Navy.
Paint gleaming and brass fittings buffed to a hospital shine, there were frigates from near-allies such as Russia, and destroyers from almost-foes like India. Their mission was friendship and diplomacy. But these were heavily armed peace envoys, warily visiting a China whose emergence as an ocean-going nation is shaking Asia, and may one day change the world. Visitors involved in territorial disputes with China, including Japan and Vietnam, sent ships bristling with weaponry. America sent no ships at all.
China sent mixed messages, too. As the celebrations began, the visitors were hailed by Mr Xi as a sort of floating United Nations. A peace-loving China yearned to work with foreign navies to secure international sea-lanes and safeguard the ocean's riches, Mr Xi declared. On state television presenters noted that, as a mainstay of anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, the Chinese navy had escorted more than 6,600 ships, from China and other countries, through bandit-infested waters.
Then came the bit which many Chinese viewers probably preferred: shots of their newest warships, dwarfing foreign visitors. Along came a Chinese ballistic-missile submarine-nuclear-powered and designed for destroying enemy cities, not arresting Somali pirates. It glided past the destroyer carrying Mr Xi, who boarded wearing a dark Mao suit befitting his other jobs as the Communist Party's general secretary and chairman of the Central Military Commission. "Comrades, greetings!" barked Mr Xi over a radio. "Chairman, greetings!" came the submariners' shouted reply. On state television, presenters compared China's newest destroyer, the 10,000-tonne Type 055, to the most powerful of America's. Screens filled with archive footage of jets roaring from the deck of the Liaoning, China's first aircraft-carrier.
On shore in the handsome, fog-shrouded port city of Qingdao, bilingual posters celebrating the naval anniversary offered variations on Mr Xi's favourite diplomatic slogans, such as: "The ocean connects us all, a community with a shared future." Others, in Chinese, hailed the navy's role as a political force, under the direct control of Mr Xi as the party's chief. A banner outside Qingdao's naval museum suggested that Mr Xi's peace of mind was the ultimate test of naval modernisation. "Obey Chairman Xi's commands. Answer to Chairman Xi. Let Chairman Xi be reassured," it read.
Cui Junkai, a 19-year-old student, had travelled from the city of Chengdu, hundreds of kilometres inland, for the fleet review. The parade-eve found Mr Cui in Qingdao's naval museum, inspecting a wooden torpedo-boat from the years when China's navy was merely a "brown-water" one, tasked with launching guerrilla attacks in muddy coastal waters. A mighty navy offers China a double benefit, Mr Cui said. "It not only defends the nation, but demonstrates our power to the outside world."
Behind the teenager, rusty patrol boats bobbed at the museum quayside, recalling the decades when China boasted a "green-water navy", capable of intimidating smaller neighbours but powerless when American battle-groups steamed by. That navy was a defensive force that aimed to ward off seaborne threats, not to project power over far horizons. In 1990 China's then-president, Jiang Zemin, urged the navy to be "the motherland's Great Wall at sea". The next Communist leader, Hu Jintao, signalled a change in 2012 when he called for China to become a "great maritime power". The navy saw its budgets soar and its fleet quality transformed. China now has the region's largest navy, with over 300 surface and underwater vessels, the Pentagon reported last year. It will have as many as 78 submarines by 2020, up from 56 in 2018, says the Pentagon.
Chinese scholars have pored over the theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan, an American navy captain and 19th-century writer on "sea power" as a source of global strength resting on three pillars: commerce, naval firepower and access to far-flung bases. Mahan was a prescient man. In a report from China's first naval base abroad, which opened in Djibouti last year, Chinese state television included a revealing on-camera prediction from the base's political commissar: that support for far-flung missions would increasingly depend on such facilities.
Change of plan
Such talk alarms military chiefs in America and other countries. Their anxiety in turn worries Hu Bo, a leading maritime strategist at Peking University. For as China's navy rises it has more than one goal, he says. First, to become a blue-water navy capable of providing security worldwide, which may perhaps involve opening a few more bases, for instance around the northern Indian Ocean. China's other goal is "near-sea control", Mr Hu says, meaning the capability to contain any threat in the western Pacific and northern Indian oceans-just as America and Russia currently enjoy comparative advantages close to home. That does not mean that China can or will evict all American ships from the South China Sea or other nearby waters, Mr Hu insists. In a generation's time he can imagine a more restrained America and a more confident China reaching a new balance of power in those near seas, after a period of competition. The dangerous period is the next five or ten years, he says. "China's capability is growing fast, but the United States is not ready to grant China status matching that power."
A balance must be reached, though. After millennia as an agrarian, continental power, China is a maritime nation, bound to the seas by strategic and commercial interests. Few foreigners would recognise the Chinese naval ensign today. That will change.

摘要: China's message to the Western world has been called an argument in three parts. In order, it runs: China's rise is inevitable; there are rich rewards for those who co-operate with it; resistance is futile. In the tree-lined embassy districts of China's capital, there is no debate about the country's rise, which inspires a mix of admiration, greed and dread. But the rest of the argument inspires more scepticism. Here, China's assertiveness is criticized.

全文文献: Headnote China's assertiveness is encouraging new solidarity among Western envoys in Beijing
China's message to the Western world has been called an argument in three parts. In order, it runs: China's rise is inevitable; there are rich rewards for those who co-operate with it; resistance is futile. In the tree-lined embassy districts of China's capital, there is no debate about the country's rise, which inspires a mix of admiration, greed and dread. But the rest of the argument inspires more scepticism.
Take that second claim about rewards awaiting China's partners. Diplomats describe much greater realism in their internal discussions. Their views are affected, inevitably, by the apparent consensus in Washington that China is a threat, bent on growing richer and more powerful at America's expense. But there has also been a broader change of mood. Only a few years ago, it is related, as soon as envoys sat to dine, "stealth boasting" would start. Isn't China tricky, the envoys would sigh-though, of course, my country's relations with it are rosy. Such bragging has become rarer.
Diplomats say that the new realism extends to countries like Germany, whose trusted brands and sought-after technology seemed to give it an upper hand in a symbiotic relationship with China. Even the biggest firms find themselves in competition with state-backed Chinese rivals that mean to defeat and replace them. France and Britain are more sober about their prospects, too, though Brexit Britain is suspected of dreaming about serving as a Singapore-style financial hub for Chinese capital.
Many countries are more clear-eyed about Chinese-led forums that have sprung up in recent years alongside older, multilateral bodies. On April 12th it looked like a win for China when Greece said it was joining the "16 plus One" group. That is a mechanism launched by China in 2012 as a way to co-ordinate its relations with a clutch of mostly eastern and central European countries, 11 of them members of the European Union (eu). That prompted talk of China trying to divide and rule in Europe. Greece is certainly eager to please China, a deep-pocketed friend. But Greece may have joined a group past its political prime. Western diplomats observe that members of what is now "17 plus One"-including the largest, Poland-seem both warier and wearier of the bloc, which has not delivered expected business opportunities and investments.
A few weeks earlier, Italy handed China a clear victory by joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (bri), a globe-spanning infrastructure plan, in defiance of advice from America, Germany and others. Still, Western governments are less starry-eyed than before. Just a couple of years ago, European leaders talked the bri up as a potential bonanza for their firms. Now they are as likely to fret about bri schemes leaving participating countries dangerously in debt, damaging the environment or locking swathes of Africa, Asia or the Asia-Pacific into technical standards set by Chinese firms.
Ahead of the Belt and Road Forum, a multinational gathering that will be hosted by President Xi Jinping in late April, Chinese officials and scholars suggest that it is time for other countries and multilateral lenders to join China in funding the bri. That brings diplomats to the third part of China's message, namely, that resistance to its rise is futile.
It would be foolish to claim that China has united the world. But the grumbling is at least more co-ordinated. Among embassies in Beijing, groupings old and new are becoming more active and useful. Some are mostly about information-sharing, such as the "Group of Five", which does not officially exist but involves a meeting at least once a month of ambassadors from America, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. Envoys from the "Five Eyes" intelligence-sharing pact (America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand) regularly meet. Other groups try to devise common policy, such as the economics-focused "Like-Minded Nine", or L9 group, comprising America, Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the eu. Embassy political officers whose briefs cover human rights have long met to co-ordinate their work. Their reports last year helped alert bosses to repression in the far-western region of Xinjiang, where China is accused of locking hundreds of thousands of Muslim members of the Uighur minority in re-education camps, and subjecting millions more to crushing surveillance. In an unusual move spearheaded by Canada, 15 Western ambassadors last year wrote to request a meeting with Chen Quanguo, Xinjiang's hardline Communist Party boss.
That led to a display of solidarity that startled China, when European ambassadors declined a peremptory invitation to visit Xinjiang. Chinese officials initially gave the ambassadors 24 hours to accept an offer to visit Xinjiang with their spouses from March 27th to 29th (though no meeting with Mr Chen would be possible). A day later the eu ambassador to Beijing was informed that this was a one-off invitation and that declining it would bring unspecified consequences. Though not all European governments are equally concerned about Xinjiang's horrors, all 28 eu members, plus Norway and Iceland, agreed that the Europeans should decline the offer. Only Albania and Serbia accepted.
China should thank Mr Trump
"Chinese assertiveness has recreated a Western community, without a doubt," says a diplomat. He notes other high points of Western unity, for instance in the aftermath of the bloodily suppressed Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Post-Tiananmen unity did not last long, he adds. Even today it has limits. The same diplomat accuses President Donald Trump of pursuing selfish, might-is-right policies that resonate more with China than with Europe. As a result, he charges, no single China strategy unites America, Europe and Japan: "The Western world does not exist."
Another diplomat counsels patience. If a different American president were to try resisting Chinese aggression while defending universal values, that "alliance is there, waiting to be led." Such talk may appal Chinese officials. They have helped to start it. ?

Chaguan: Curling power

摘要: China's ambitions for grand sporting achievements through curling, a team game played on ice that was almost unknown in the country 20 years ago, is discussed.

全文文献: Headnote China is new to the ice sport. Its plans to excel at it say much about the country's rise
In the past athletes in China had a particular image problem, reports Lei Yi, a sports official. Almost universally, she regrets to say, people thought that sports were for strong, fit people who "don't have a brain". Happily, views have changed. Specifically, says Ms Lei, sports are seen as a way to teach young Chinese useful lessons about working hard, believing in themselves and in their team, and not giving up easily.
If Ms Lei's case for sports sounds a little light on fun and heavy on improving virtues, she has an excuse. She is a team leader from China's General Administration of Sport, and has less than four years to prepare a dozen perfectly trained athletes for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022. Her domain is curling, a team game played on ice that was almost unknown in China 20 years ago. Almost five centuries after matches were first recorded on the frozen ponds of Scotland and the Low Countries, curling has been declared a sport that plays to China's strengths.
Curling is a bit like lawn bowls, except played on ice with a lump of polished granite that can, as it glides, have its trajectory altered by team-mates madly scrubbing the ice in its path. The stone's squat shape gives the sport its Chinese name of binghu, or "ice kettle". The central authorities and local governments are building curling rinks from Tianjin on the coast to Xining on the Tibetan plateau. They eventually hope to build them in every province, says Ms Lei. During the Winter Olympics in 2022 a swimming arena from the Beijing games of 2008, the Water Cube, will host curling matches as the Ice Cube.
Kate Caithness, president of the World Curling Federation, the governing body based in Scotland, has become a frequent visitor to China. She found officials drawn to curling's reputation as "chess on ice"-a brainy sport best mastered by years of dogged practice. Ms Caithness watched as Beijing Sports University opened a college of curling last year, and as it promptly began scouring the student population for youngsters with the right mix of stamina and mental toughness to play the sport.
The aim is to meet two distinct goals set by Xi Jinping, the country's leader. At the elite level, China has a reasonable chance of winning Olympic medals in curling, says Ms Caithness. That would fulfil Mr Xi's quest for grand sporting achievements, of a sort that would bring closer his "Chinese dream" of prosperity and national pride. At the amateur level, the game is accessible enough to help meet another of Mr Xi's stated targets, namely to turn at least 300m Chinese into winter-sports enthusiasts.
Just in case the squad that Ms Lei oversees was not feeling enough pressure, in February Mr Xi dropped in on their camp at the National Winter Sports Training Centre. "Strong sports make the country strong and a strong country makes sports strong," he declared. The squad could be a metaphor for a rising China. It is part of a national programme for high performance in sports. The team comprises 60 curlers, ranging in age from 18 to 35. They live in a boarding house and practise, work out and take lessons in patriotism for six days a week. Their base is a sleek new complex of glass, concrete and painted metal beams in the heart of the former Shougang steelworks, an old state-owned factory that closed in 2011. Ice-skating and ice-hockey teams have their own camps nearby. To either side loom the rusting hulks of disused blast furnaces, wrapped in bulbous, elephantine pipework.
Asked about curling's appeal in China, Ms Lei notes that it is one of very few team sports in the Winter Olympics. That matters, because in Chinese culture "we always advocate that you need to put your country's interest over your personal interest, and your team's interest over your personal interest," she says. She describes how, in curling, a skilful player may have to bow to the team's interest and take a boringly safe shot, rather than "have a showtime" and try for personal glory. She describes an almost military chain of command, with the "skip" or captain at the top.
If some sports reward individual creativity, even a touch of wildness, others favour discipline. Ms Lei says there is creativity in curling, but concedes that "discipline is more important". Patience, too, is needed to endure three-hour games, and tournaments that could involve 33 hours on the ice, or "torture", as Ms Lei cheerfully calls it.
The junior game is a bit more joyful, as a visit to the Xuhui District Youth Sports School in Shanghai shows. In China winter sports are associated with the country's bluff, hard-living northeast. But affluent Shanghai, as if eager to shed its business-obsessed, slightly effete image, has invested in three curling rinks since 2012. In all 1,500 students have signed up. It helps that curling is less dangerous than ice hockey and speed skating, says Zhou Wenjia, general secretary of the Shanghai Curling Association. "Shanghai parents are quite protective of their kids," she explains. Her association assures anxious parents that sports will develop their children's willpower, as well as their physical fitness. "I don't know if it's authoritative, but I have heard that Chinese and Jewish people have the highest iqs," adds Ms Zhou, venturing that this gives Chinese players "quite the advantage".
Taking part is good, winning even better
On this spring evening dozens of teenagers wait to go on the ice. With national youth games coming up, they are practising six nights a week with their professional coach, Kim Ji-sun, who was skip of the South Korean women's team at the Sochi Olympics in 2014. Tang Qinsheng, waiting for his grandson in the rink's viewing gallery, credits team sports with making the 13-year-old more outgoing, as well as more organised about doing his homework between practices. He approves of curling, calling it "a refined sport".
To date Canada is the world's curling superpower, with over a million regular players. China has a long way to go but-as in other areas-its ambitions already reveal a lot. ?

全文文献: Headnote Abandoning the doctrine of "hide your capacities, bide your time" has costs
BY THE TIME Chinese censors finally allowed a James Bond film to be shown in a mainland cinema, in 2007, the franchise was more than four decades old. Only thanks to rampant piracy were Chinese familiar with the British spy, commonly referred to by his codename, Ling ling qi. Chinese leaders would do well to study a plot device beloved in the early films: the moment when a ruthless genius explains his plans for world domination to a captive Bond, believing him moments from death. With the reliability of a welltuned Aston Martin, the bragging turns out to be ill-timed. Within moments Bond is free, the villain's lair ablaze and his schemes thwarted. Today in the real world, China faces unusual resistance to its bid for a front seat as a global power. Surprisingly often, China's woes stem from what film critics might term Bond-villain blunders, involving premature admissions of ambition.
Take the ongoing campaign by American officials to scold allies into shunning Chinese high-technology for 5G mobile-telecommunications networks. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, says that America may refuse to share intelligence with governments that install kit from such tech giants as Huawei, a firm that Mr Pompeo accuses of having "deep connections" to Chinese spy services. Allies grumble that American officials have not shared hard evidence to back their claims. On March 15th Li Keqiang, China's prime minister, declared that his government would never ask companies to break the law to spy on other countries, insisting: "This is not how China behaves." Alas, Mr Li's words cannot fully soothe foreign governments and businesses who know what Chinese law openly permits. Notably, an intelligence law of 2017 decrees that all Chinese organisations and citizens are obliged to cooperate with national intelligence-gathering operations. None may demur if spooks requisition their premises or equipment.
China hawks in America, among them Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, have seized on another admission: the "Made in China 2025" plan, an ambitious road map for high-tech industrial policy adopted four years ago. A Senate committee which Mr Rubio chairs issued a report in February examining targets linked to Made in China 2025 that call for Chinese firms to dominate domestic markets for such products as semiconductors and electric vehicles. The report concedes that, in one respect, Americans should thank state planners for identifying favoured industries. China's plans provide "a blueprint for effective defensive action", from tariffs punishing unfair technology transfers, to schemes supporting American firms, Team Rubio writes.
Nor is Europe rolling over like a Bond villain's cat. On March 12th the European Commission and the European Union's foreign policy arm, the EU External Action Service, issued a strikingly bleak strategic paper on China. The document calls China a partner when battling such global menaces as climate change, as well as an economic competitor. But it also calls China a "systemic rival" whose engagement with the world of norms, rules and multilateral organisations is "selective" at best, and at worst weakens that order. Like America's Senate, the Euro-paper also singles out the Made in China 2025 plan. It sees a scheme to shield high-tech national champions from competition, while EU firms are forced to hand prized technologies to local partners as a precondition for entering China's markets. The EU paper urges European governments to maintain unity as they demand reciprocal trade terms.
Europe's unity will be tested when President Xi Jinping visits Italy between March 22nd and 24th. While there he aims to sign that country up for the Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure scheme. America and some European governments have urged Italy to be cautious about endorsing a project that is-as critics tell it-a debt-fuelled master plan for a parallel, China-led global order. China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged Italy to ignore such qualms and sign up, saying: "We trust you'll stick to the decision you have independently made." As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials downplay its import, calling it just another plan from a nation full of planners, whose most alarming buy-Chinese targets are from non-binding guidance documents.
In a bid to sweeten trade-war peace talks with America, China announced that it will enact a new foreign-investment law in January. Among other promises, the law says that overseas firms' secrets will not be leaked when shared with government regulators. Foreign chambers of commerce in China responded warily, noting the law's lack of detail. For many foreign executives in China, industrial policies announced over the past four years are a Bondvillainesque instance of candour. It is when they realised that China's long-term vision for the future may not include them at all.
Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr Bond, I expect you to die
It is often said that today's China is more assertive. Certainly China has broken with the dictum of the early 1990s, coined by the thensupreme leader, Deng Xiaoping, that China should "hide its capacities and bide its time". In truth China is now too big to hide. It has always mixed bursts of assertiveness with promises to open markets and protect foreign firms. What is new is that this China is impatient. Officials increasingly chafe when foreign powers cite global norms and rules as grounds for disapproval. A public steeped in propaganda about China's greatness is indignant when the country is-as ordinary Chinese see it-denied due respect. All those forces stoke impatience. Whether that backfires depends on how other countries respond. America could ban its high-tech firms from some forms of business with China. European governments could start screening Chinese investments more strictly. Predicting the West's response is made harder by President Donald Trump. He is as bored by norms and rules, and as obsessed with respect, as any Bond villain. Privately, smart Chinese policy types lament their country's new fondness for boasting. Many Chinese officials will not listen; they are in too great a hurry.

摘要: Xi Jinping is encouraging a boom in "independent" Chinese think-tanks and what does that mean. To ensure a supply of diverse opinions, even as public debates face strict controls, Mr Xi is encouraging a boom in "think-tanks with Chinese characteristics". State-funded think-tanks, many of them serving individual ministries or Communist Party bodies, have long existed in China. Chaguan asked the heads of some very different think-tanks about another puzzle: that proximity to power is good for prestige but bad for credibility, especially in an autocracy. Wang Huiyao leads the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank that promotes free trade and greater opening to the world. Mr Wang is proud that his "independent" think-tank is funded by Chinese entrepreneurs and companies, not the state.

全文文献: Headnote Xi Jinping is encouraging a boom in "independent" Chinese think-tanks. What does that mean?
FRUSTRATED BY the quality of the advice he was receiving, the first Song emperor of China had an idea. The tenth-century ruler, it is said, promised that officials would not be executed for disagreeing with him. President Xi Jinping appears to be testing a less flamboyant remedy to a similar problem. To ensure a supply of diverse opinions, even as public debates face strict controls, Mr Xi is encouraging a boom in "think-tanks with Chinese characteristics".
State-funded think-tanks, many of them serving individual ministries or Communist Party bodies, have long existed in China. But recent years have seen a flourishing of think-tanks that eschew direct state sponsorship. Some are privately funded foundations, or attached to universities. Others register as private consulting firms, bringing both flexibility and vulnerability.
The boom throws up puzzles. In the West, measuring clout is easy. When a Democrat wins the White House, a flotilla of progressive wonks bobs across Washington from places like the Brookings Institution to join the government. When a Republican is elected, conservative wonks who share the winner's politics take their turn- hard-edged partisan think-tanks have hit the jackpot under President Donald Trump. In Europe, think-tanks send staff into government as special advisers and work to shape public debate. Assessing influence is harder in China, where the revolving door is one-way: officials may retire into think-tanks, but seldom return to government. And the party in power never changes.
In China, real influence is rarely wielded in public. Among researchers, the term neibu ("internal") is used a lot. Each day, favoured think-tanks and universities send policy papers via neibu channels to Mr Xi and other leaders. If he reads a paper, or-a high honour-scrawls a note in its margins, aides send word to its authors, casting a roseate glow over all involved. Well-connected think-tanks send staff to internal government and party meetings. Behind closed doors, their scholars weigh in on big, divisive questions. An example is the Belt and Road Initiative, a scheme to connect the world with railway lines, telecommunications networks and other infrastructure. Some think-tanks argue that China gains by funding and controlling the project. Others call it a financial and diplomatic burden that should be shared with other countries. During the trade war with America, scholars have been summoned to advise on the wording of Chinese government announcements. Smart think-tanks prepare public and neibu versions of papers. They are also asked by officials to advance arguments that bigwigs prefer not to make aloud. Distrust any policy wonk who claims to speak for a grandee, though, says a prominent researcher. "If he is really close to those VVVIPS, he cannot tell you."
Chaguan asked the heads of some very different think-tanks about another puzzle: that proximity to power is good for prestige but bad for credibility, especially in an autocracy. Diplomats and foreign analysts call the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) the country's shrewdest foreign-policy think-tank, despite (or perhaps because of) its links to the deep state. With over 200 scholars following both individual countries and broad questions of national security, CICIR's leafy campus resembles a small university. Paramilitary guards and massive gates hint at CICIR's (unacknowledged) affiliation with the Ministry of State Security, China's main intelligence service. CICIR's president, Yuan Peng, notes that Western think-tanks use punchy phrases and attack politicians for past blunders. CICIR uses "subtle" language to describe present realities accurately and to offer constructive suggestions about the future, he says. Mr Yuan accepts no lessons about objectivity from the West, calling American thinktanks beholden to rich ideologues: "Western think-tanks are independent from government, but not from interest groups."
Wang Huiyao leads the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think-tank that promotes free trade and greater opening to the world. Mr Wang is proud that his "independent" think-tank is funded by Chinese entrepreneurs and companies, not the state. But he is an outsider with neibu access, serving as an appointed adviser to the State Council, or cabinet, and as vice-chairman of a group that seeks to influence foreign-educated Chinese, the Western Returned Scholars Association. Today's China may not allow political competition, but it has opened a door to "political-proposal competition", he argues.
The Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, which is backed by private donors but attached to Renmin University, an elite academy in Beijing, is headed by Wang Wen, a rising star on what might be dubbed the Make China Great Again right. He downplays his rumoured access to powerful folk, insisting that Chinese leaders consult widely, gathering opinions "like bees collect nectar". The institute's walls are thick with framed photographs of foreign dignitaries, for favoured think-tanks also do quasi-diplomatic work.
Sending honest scholars into exile: a long tradition
True independence brings costs. The Unirule Institute for Economics, founded in 1993 by distinguished liberal reformers, is under siege. It currently perches in a small apartment in north Beijing, down a hallway crowded with bicycles and buckets of yellowing vegetables. The government last year cancelled the business licence of one of its sponsoring entities, after Unirule criticised policies that favour state monopolies and hamper private firms. Authorities say its fault was hosting training courses without an educational permit. Its director, Sheng Hong, was until January a member of Chinese Economists 50 Forum, a body closely linked to Liu He, a deputy prime minister who is Mr Xi's chief economic adviser. Mr Sheng says forum members feel they are offering advice to national leaders. But access comes with "invisible limitations". Too often, sensitive subjects are not raised, he says.
Wise emperors understood this. Diverse opinions may provoke autocratic rulers. What really hurts is the advice they never hear.

全文文献: Headnote China's rulers reveal more than intended with clunky propaganda about their accountability
THE ANNUAL sitting of the National People's Congress, China's well-fed eunuch of a parliament, poses several tests for foreign reporters. Though its committees may suggest tweaks to new laws, and some play a diplomatic role engaging with foreign legislators, meetings of its 3,000 or so delegates are mostly very dull. Indeed, the congress has never voted down a proposal from Communist Party chiefs. There is the puzzle of whether to join a yearly propaganda show in which foreign journalists are given plum seats at leaders' press conferences and urged to pre-submit questions that few will be invited to ask-allowing state media to show domestic audiences the world's press, hands aloft and clamouring to join this simulacrum of representative democracy.
There is the security that grips Beijing during the "two sessions", the simultaneous gatherings of the legislature and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body stuffed with business bosses, academics, sports stars, religious leaders and other grandees. Notably, cyber-police disrupt the online services, known as vpns, that offer a route past the Great Firewall of censorship. For foreign reporters, the sessions' great drama often involves guessing whether they will be able to use the internet to file their stories about the government's accountability.
Finally, there is the odd experience of meeting supposed colleagues who are in fact complete strangers, meaning foreigners employed by Chinese state media, or by obscure Western news outlets that channel Chinese propaganda. Some ask planted questions at press conferences. Others pop up in the state media lauding China's political system. Xinhua, China's official news agency, this year put out a video entitled "Chinese democracy in the eyes of an American". A fresh-faced young man from Chicago, Colin Linneweber, strolls around Tiananmen Square while opining that "it's widely acknowledged that a key to China's success is its system of democracy", and praising the country's "stability". He then presents mini-profiles of delegates with such day jobs as farmer, migrant worker and postman, whose proposals for making China better became law. It is tempting to be quite cross with such Westerners. Ordinary Chinese who start praising democracy on the square, a ghost-haunted, massively policed spot, would be instantly arrested. Stability comes at a price, what is more. China's one-party rule involves more than the absence of messy things like real elections or a free press. It requires active, unsleeping maintenance by state-security agents tasked with tracking, threatening or jailing any who challenge the Communist monopoly on power.
As far back as China's civil war, party leaders called themselves democrats, unlike their dictatorial rivals, the Nationalist Party or Kuomintang. In 1945 Mao Zedong impressed Chinese intellectuals when he assured a businessman and educational reformer, Huang Yanpei, that democracy would help a Communist government avoid cycles of triumph and decline that doomed imperial dynasties. "Only when a government is subject to the people's supervision will it not dare to slacken," Mao declared. Huang came to realise how much he had misjudged Mao. In 1957 he saw the party turn on his son, Huang Wanli, an engineer who (correctly) sounded the alarm about flaws in a planned dam on the Yellow River. When his warnings were not heeded, the younger Huang noted that the American people could remove officials from office. He was purged as a "rightist" and sentenced to hard labour.
After Mao's death, when economic opening was not matched by political liberalisation, party leaders sounded a bit defensive about that choice, assuring foreigners that only a firm grip on their vast country could avoid chaos. In the 1990s rule passed to Jiang Zemin, an admirer of Western culture who loved to quote Abraham Lincoln's call for government of, by and for the people. Asked by an American interviewer whether China was a dictatorship, Mr Jiang replied that he was the elected head of a collective party leadership, although the method of his election had to take account of China's levels of economic and educational development.
Jump to the present day, and foreigners hear no such half-apologies from the China led by President Xi Jinping. Mr Xi calls China a socialist, consultative democracy, featuring the "orderly participation" of the people and always under the party's control. Today, state media hail China's political system as far more responsive and effective than the West's "conflict-driven", money-tainted politics. The recent government shutdown in America, Brexit-related confusion and gilets jaunes riots in France are all held up in China as examples of Western decadence and failure. Talking politics to ordinary Chinese is a chastening experience. A bicycle repairman in Beijing, after ascertaining that Chaguan is British, scoffs: "That prime minister? May? Total chaos, isn't it?"
Let the people be heard
Opinion polling is hard in China, where candour can be dangerous. Still, the Asian Barometer Survey, run by National Taiwan University, has on four occasions quizzed the Chinese public about democracy. Writing in the Taiwan Journal of Democracy, Yue Yin, a political scientist, notes that a narrow majority of the survey's respondents in China support press censorship in the name of stability, while two-thirds say they are at ease with one-party rule. Yet accountability matters. Nearly 80% reject a government in which "experts decide everything" and 60% say the public should be free to criticise the authorities.
That suggests another way to understand propaganda films in which foreigners call the legislature a beacon of democracy. Such videos are a backhanded tribute to the West. An American's views on accountable government carry weight, because ordinary Chinese know that American voters can kick the bums out. For now, China's rulers still mind when their authoritarian system is judged against Western norms. When they no longer think they need the Colin Linnewebers of this world, start worrying.

摘要: Many governments are reviewing whether to let Huawei help build 5G mobile networks. Some, such as Australia, have already banned the firm. Huawei bosses say that they run a normal private company, and are not beholden to any state. Yet Huawei's supposed independence is not easy to square with China's all-out defence of the firm. A Western country reviewing 5G plans was startled to hear Chinese foreign ministry officials call Huawei's fate a "core" concern. If that wording was deliberate, in theory that ranks Huawei with such vital interests as the status of Taiwan. Here, whether the West should trust China as a pillar of high-tech globalization is examined.

全文文献: Headnote Western countries are being bullied by China and America over Huawei. China frightens them more
CANADIAN DIPLOMATS in China recently carried out one of their grimmer duties: paying a monthly visit to a former colleague, Michael Kovrig, who is being detained by state security agents. Mr Kovrig, a diplomat for over a decade before joining the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention charity, was grabbed off a Beijing street on December 10th. He is being held in a room kept brightly lit at all times, and questioned for up to six hours a day. Granted one consular visit a month, Mr Kovrig may not see his family or hire a lawyer. On this occasion friends gave the consuls messages to read to him (handing over letters is banned). Mr Kovrig, a lover of jazz, the blues and literature-he likes the science fiction of Harlan Ellison-was allowed to receive a book. Though accused of endangering China's national security, a catch-all offence, Mr Kovrig has not been charged with any crime.
Mr Kovrig is, in effect, a hostage. He is being held because on December 1st Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of Huawei, a telecommunications giant, and the daughter of its founder. The action was taken at the request of American prosecutors, who accuse Ms Meng of scheming to sidestep sanctions against Iran. Along with Mr Kovrig, China has detained a second Canadian, Michael Spavor, who runs tours to North Korea. Even the most urbane Chinese officials turn icy when pressed about their treatment of Canada, Chaguan can report. Their line is that China had to respond forcefully to the arrest of Ms Meng. They swat away the idea that Canada is merely following its extradition treaty with America. They give no credit to Canada's rule of law (Ms Meng is free on bail and living in her handsome Vancouver home). In their telling, Canada made a political choice to please America, while angering China. Now Canada must feel pain, so the next time America asks for such help every ally will think twice.
The Kovrig case has shaken diplomatic Beijing. China's agents are reported to have quizzed Mr Kovrig about his years at Canada's embassy there, when his work-analysing Chinese politics by cultivating official and scholarly contacts-enjoyed diplomatic immunity. A source at another embassy says China's apparent breach of the Vienna Convention has "frightened" some staff.
Several diplomats call China's actions self-defeating. Many governments are reviewing whether to let Huawei help build 5G mobile networks. Some, such as Australia, have already banned the firm. Huawei bosses say that they run a normal private company, and are not beholden to any state. Yet Huawei's supposed independence is not easy to square with China's all-out defence of the firm. A Western country reviewing 5G plans was startled to hear Chinese foreign ministry officials call Huawei's fate a "core" concern. If that wording was deliberate, in theory that ranks Huawei with such vital interests as the status of Taiwan.
What kind of country is China?
This is a fight bigger than Huawei. The West is really debating whether China can be trusted as a pillar of high-tech globalisation. Decisions about public procurement lie on a spectrum, with easy questions at each extreme. Can a Western army safely buy bootlaces from China? Obviously, yes. Would a Russian firm be hired to rewire the Pentagon? Clearly, no. Whether Huawei should help build 5G networks is a hard question, somewhere in between those two extremes. When cyber-spooks in Britain, say, declare that the technical risks of using Huawei kit can be managed, they mean that 5G switches are more like bootlaces than many realise. For their part, Huawei's critics in America, led by Vice-President Mike Pence and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, stress the risks of entrusting any sensitive infrastructure to any Chinese firm. Put another way, they mean that China is an adversary like Russia.
Team Trump has casually tossed about some momentous threats. Trump envoys told Poland's leaders that doing business with Huawei threatens Poles' dreams of a permanent American troop presence on Polish soil. Mr Pompeo suggested to the Fox Business Network, a television channel, that the use of Chinese telecommunications technology is incompatible with membership of the "Five Eyes" intelligence-sharing group, comprising America, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. If a country puts Huawei gear into critical information systems, "we won't be able to share information with them," Mr Pompeo asserted. Allies hope that is not official policy. One diplomat says that Mr Pompeo's words took other bits of America's government by surprise.
If Mr Pompeo causes surprises, his boss provokes unhappy bewilderment. President Trump has publicly suggested that he might bargain away Ms Meng's extradition for the right trade deal with China-undermining Canada's insistence that her fate hinges on the law, not politics. Welcoming Chinese negotiators to the Oval Office on February 22nd, Mr Trump said that a longmooted executive order outlawing Chinese telecommunications technology from American networks "may or may not" be on the table during trade talks. In Beijing's leafy embassy districts, diplomats know the conclusion that China would like them to draw, namely that no principles guide American criticisms of Huawei, merely clumsy ambitions to contain China as a technological rival.
In truth, many countries feel bullied by both China and Team Trump. Diplomats are depressed that hopes of engaging China, for instance in tackling climate change, are being derailed by discussions about Chinese undermining of Western democratic life, rampant state-sponsored commercial espionage and other alleged sins. Across the West, intelligence agencies have gained unusual sway over China policy, says a diplomat, adding that spies bring a distinctive grimness to such debates: "We're out here walking in the sunlight, those guys move in a darker world."
A less aggressive China could easily capitalise on divisions among Western countries over Huawei. Instead China is using fear to pursue its goals. Hence the bleak mood in Beijing embassies.

全文文献: Headnote Economic woes are hurting Chinese journalists as much as censorship does
SOME DAUNTING obstacles must be overcome to study journalism at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), home to the region's best college for reporters. Applicants must speak good English, find annual tuition fees of over $25,000 and-to secure places on courses that are oversubscribed each year-persuade HKU professors that their interest in journalism is heartfelt. A surprising number of mainland Chinese youngsters, who represent about 60% of students on the master's programme for journalism, then face a further obstacle: telephone calls from parents, begging them to shun careers in news lest they doom their whole family.
A group of mainland students, hosting Chaguan in an HKU common room, share stories of tough parental calls. Lansie (her chosen name in English) fields frequent pleas from her mother to avoid writing about Chinese politics, which end: "Do you want US all to be in prison?" Fernando's father works for the state media, but still he urges his son to start a business and forget about the "noble things" journalism can do. As for Ann, her family's concerns seem more trivial. Her parents have begged her "thousands of times" to consider a career in finance. They complain that, for now, they are respectably middle-class. But if Ann becomes a journalist they fear she will pull them into poverty.
Parents are right that Chinese journalists can lose their jobs, and in rare cases their freedom, if they touch on sensitive subjects or challenge the state or a powerful vested interest. When outsiders say that that China lacks a free press, they are usually talking about such controls, which have grown stricter since Xi Jinping became China's leader in 2012.
Yet within the news industry the blows that hurt most, day-today, are economic, not political. Ann's parents are not snobbish outliers to worry about money. They give voice to a fear that every week drives good journalists to quit, many to jobs in public relations. It is hard to lead a middle-class life on a journalist's pay, or to start a family. A junior reporter in Beijing may earn $1,000 a month, barely enough to cover the rent. China's newspapers enjoyed a golden age of profitability from the mid-1990s until 2010 or so. The boldest tested the limits of censorship and held (some) powerful wrongdoers to account. Those business models have collapsed, as consumers desert traditional outlets for bite-sized, often sensational social-media posts, watched on smartphones.
A remarkable new study in the Journal of Communication details how readers and advertisers have fled metropolitan newspapers. More than 100 editors, managers and reporters, from obscure inland provinces to giant coastal cities, were interviewed for the study "Chinese Newspaper Groups in the Digital Era: The Resurgence of the Party Press". The authors, Wang Haiyan of Sun Yat Sen University in the southern city of Guangzhou, and Colin Sparks of Hong Kong Baptist University, recall the rise of powerful provincial newspaper groups, typically anchored by a staid-but-authoritative party paper, for instance Southern Daily in Guangzhou, and commercially driven sister titles, such as Southern Metropolis Daily. All such newspapers report to provincial propaganda departments. But when "metro" papers were at their most profitable they could defy lowly officials, answering only to the most senior.
The best used that breathing-space to report on wrongdoing by officials below them in the pecking order or in other provinces. Scoops were painstakingly gathered by their own reporters, or were slipped to them by colleagues from other provinces whose work was being suppressed by local censors-a trick known as "supervision in another place". The study quotes anonymous editors recalling glory days when propaganda directors would plead with them to stop exposing blunders, with one reduced to asking: "Can you stop for a while and perhaps you can continue next year?"
It did not last. Total Chinese newspaper circulation peaked in 2012, and newspaper-advertising revenues plunged by 75% between 2012 and 2016. Since then, staid party newspapers have proved more resilient than their commercial cousins. For one thing, the Southern Daily and its kind can rely on government subscriptions. Recently, party papers have been seeing more advertisements placed by local governments hoping to buy positive coverage of their policies, and to impress higher-ups. At the same time party newspapers, including the most important, the People's Daily, have been ordered to create digital sites and apps. Often backed by hefty subsidies, some are unexpectedly lively. Meanwhile, ailing titles are expanding side-businesses. The study reports on a group with morning newspapers that uses its distribution network to deliver eggs and fruit in the afternoons.
The revenge of the People's Daily
Investigative journalism is not extinct in China. The boldest business publications, such as Caixin, still expose crooked firms. Optimists note the cacophonous rise of bloggers and social-media sites on commercial platforms such as Weibo or WeChat. Some blogs are written by veteran journalists and publicise stories that evoke such a public response, so rapidly, that censors cannot contain them, leaving state media scrambling to catch up. A good example involves a scandal involving childhood vaccines last year. Such successes help to explain why young Chinese want to study journalism. Cao Peixin, who teaches broadcast journalism at the Communication University of China in Beijing, notes that 8,000 students applied this year for 30 undergraduate places. Students see journalism as a cause, not an industry, he says.
But, with career ladders collapsing, it is not clear how idealistic youngsters can become authoritative journalist-bloggers. Revealingly, even HKU students determined to defy parental qualms to work as reporters are doubtful about returning to the mainland. Censorship is one reason, but also low pay. Chinese journalists have long sacrificed safety and a quiet life to do good work. They now wonder if they must forgo their dignity, too.

全文文献: Headnote A new book examines why China is gloomier than its economic success would predict
IT TOOK 125 years for America's Declaration of Independence to reach a wide Chinese audience, and when it did, some lofty phrases got lost. The earliest known Chinese translation of the declaration, published in 1901 by young nationalists burning to overthrow the Qing empire, is an impatient, combative text. The document's name, noted the scholar who rediscovered it, Frank Li of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, became the "American War Proclamation of Independence". The rights it deemed inalienable-"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"-turned into something bleaker: "life, liberty and all interests".
Happiness remains a thorny subject in China. Since 2012 the UN has sponsored a World Happiness Report, for which residents of about 150 countries are asked how satisfied they are with their lives. China ranked 86th in the latest report, below Russia and even war-torn Libya. Some foreign observers find it easy to explain China's relative gloom. They see a system built on an unsentimental bargain between rulers and ruled. Citizens may enjoy the fruits of economic growth but may not protest against the costs, from pollution to yawning inequality. Such experts scoff when today's Communist leaders say that they set great store by increasing public happiness as part of the Chinese Dream, President Xi Jinping's campaign to make China great again. These cynics imagine that Team Xi's true priority is to keep the economy growing quickly, on the assumption that material gains are the only thing that can keep a long-suffering public in line.
This cynical theory is popular but wrong. "Chinese Discourses on Happiness" is a timely new collection of essays edited by two sinologists based in Britain, Gerda Wielander and Derek Hird. It explores how China's propaganda machine devotes extraordinary efforts to promoting the idea that the Chinese people enjoy good and meaningful lives under Communism-precisely because economic growth alone does a poor job of generating happiness.
Back in 1974 Richard Easterlin, an American economist, spotted a puzzle. Although richer countries are generally more contented, rising material prosperity does not necessarily lead to ever-higher levels of self-reported well-being. "Chinese Discourses" calls China a giant Easterlin Paradox. Chinese real GDP per person grew more than fivefold between 1990 and 2015. Yet, rather than climbing in lockstep with the economy, the self-reported happiness of the Chinese fell sharply from 1990, reaching a nadir in 2000-05 (a time of breakneck GDP growth) before recovering. It has probably yet to regain the level of 1990.
A chapter of the 2017 World Happiness Report, co-written by Mr Easterlin, dug into Chinese data from the previous quarter-century and found weak correlations between happiness and several trends commonly blamed for gloom. Take inequality of income, which in China marched upwards between 1980 and about 2010. During the same period levels of self-reported happiness fell and rose in a и-shape. The chapter studies other "predictors" of happiness, including the consumption of coal (a proxy for pollution), housing prices, GDP per person, healthy-life expectancy, self-reported levels of freedom to make big decisions and corruption (measured by asking whether bribery is acceptable). None of these indicators tracks happiness closely in China. Two others are a good fit: unemployment and access to social safety nets. Misery, notably among low-income Chinese, deepened as unemployment spiked and safety nets collapsed in 2000-05, as state-owned firms were restructured. As employment rebounded, so did happiness.
Even people normally considered clear beneficiaries of China's economic opening-the hundreds of millions of rural migrants who found work in cities over the past 30 years-are not collectively cheerier. The most recent World Happiness Report, from 2018, finds that, on average, Chinese migrants secure higher incomes by moving to cities but, once there, say they are less happy than longestablished city folk. More surprisingly, such migrants are also unhappier than cousins who stayed in the countryside. Dig into the numbers, and the jobs of the unhappiest migrants are unusually insecure, harsh and badly paid, thrusting them into an underclass made more painful by hukou residency laws that limit their access to schooling for their children and other public services. Rising prosperity cannot compensate for a sense of being left out.
Happy is as happy is told to do
"Chinese Discourses" suggests that party chiefs have long worried about such risks. In the 1950s they pledged to build a "prosperous and happy socialist society". Today, in the Xi era, a similar message is rammed home in television shows, posters and websites lauding model citizens who find joy in serving the country. Some propaganda is plain sneaky. A contributor to the new book, Jigme Yeshe Lama of the University of Calcutta, notes that state media declared the tense, heavily policed Tibetan capital, Lhasa, "China's happiest city" for six years in a row. That improbable feat was achieved by deeming government policies, from imposing tight security to building highways or pushing Tibetans into modern jobs, to be the definition of happiness.
Other propaganda is more subtle. Party homilies about collective happiness, common in the 1950s, have been replaced by stories about well-being on two levels: the personal and the national. Individuals are told that they are xingfu, or "happy and blessed", because Chinese families are made strong by traditional values. In turn, Mr Xi likes to say, families are made secure and prosperous by loyal membership of "the great family of the Chinese nation". With his stories about tradition and belonging, Mr Xi may just be on to something. A happiness gap between rich and poor has narrowed as the lowest earners report greater well-being, to an extent that economic growth numbers alone do not explain. To stern Communist Party chiefs, few rights are inalienable. But the human need to be promised a good life? That is self-evident.

摘要: Chinese leaders have limited patience for Taiwanese opinion. Their offer to the democratic island of 23m is ostensibly generous. Under the slogan "One Country, Two Systems", Taiwan is promised lots of autonomy alongside access to China's vast market. This is backed by honeyed words about unifying a family sundered for 70 years, since China's civil war ended with the losing Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang retreating to what they hoped would be temporary exile on Taiwan. Still, China is committed to using force to block any bid for formal independence. Chinese optimists call time their ally, as Taiwan's population ages and its economy slows. Chaguan visited Taiwan recently. It is true that China's gleaming coastal cities make Taipei's 1980s skyscrapers look shabby. But time is China's foe too, says Freddy Lim, a heavy-metal rock star and legislator for Taiwan's pro-independence New Power Party.

全文文献: Headnote Ostracism of pro-independence Taiwanese is dangerous and counterproductive
If china's rulers ever decide to invade Taiwan-a grim but not impossible prospect-they will need good answers to two questions. First, would the People's Liberation Army win? The consensus in Taipei is that the pla is close to that goal but is not "100% sure" of victory. Second, would ordinary Taiwanese submit?
Chinese leaders have limited patience for Taiwanese opinion. Their offer to the democratic island of 23m is ostensibly generous. Under the slogan "One Country, Two Systems", Taiwan is promised lots of autonomy alongside access to China's vast market. This is backed by honeyed words about unifying a family sundered for 70 years, since China's civil war ended with the losing Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (kmt) retreating to what they hoped would be temporary exile on Taiwan. Still, China is committed to using force to block any bid for formal independence.
Chinese optimists call time their ally, as Taiwan's population ages and its economy slows. Chaguan visited Taiwan recently. It is true that China's gleaming coastal cities make Taipei's 1980s skyscrapers look shabby. But time is China's foe too, says Freddy Lim, a heavy-metal rock star and legislator for Taiwan's pro-independence New Power Party. Mr Lim cites polls showing that youngsters increasingly identify as Taiwanese and consider China another country, albeit one where they like to do business.
Embrace the motherland, or else
Put bluntly, China's proposals sound creepy to many young, urban Taiwanese. In effect, they hear a demand to submit to marriage with a stern cousin, arranged decades ago: "I am rich now, let me cherish you-or I will kill you."
Taiwanese defiance may anger China's leaders. But they cannot safely ignore it. Any Chinese victory would need to be quick, with Taiwan's will to fight broken so swiftly that calls for an American rescue become moot. Taiwanese security experts are frank about what they fear: a psychological collapse among the public, for instance after initial waves of Chinese missiles wreck more than half the island's defences, or blow up oil and gas terminals to cut power supplies. Then there is the question of what happens the day after China wins. Politicians predict mass protests in Taiwanese cities. Would China send tanks to subdue its sullen new satrapy?
Alas, China has closed off avenues to answering such questions. Communist bosses growl that they will only engage with Taiwanese who agree that their island is part of China. That excludes President Tsai Ing-wen and her ruling Democratic Progressive Party (dpp). The dpp says that the island they govern is a country in its own right, though to avoid a crisis they fudge what they mean by that. In their desire to teach Taiwanese voters that dpp rule brings pain and isolation, China has sought to ostracise the party since Ms Tsai won election in 2016. Government-to-government contacts have been limited to such technical subjects as airtraffic control, food safety and some police co-operation, for instance when one side seeks the return of a fleeing murderer. Chinese pressure is blamed for sharp declines in tourism from the mainland and in short-term exchanges by mainland students, though about 3,500 Chinese students remain in Taiwan on degree courses. Even scholars close to the dpp have been blacklisted from travel to China, among them Tseng Chien-yuan of Chung Hua University. He adds that Chinese academics he has known for decades are now barred from formal contacts with him. "I worry about this situation, because if the Chinese government only hears what it wants to know, they can never understand Taiwan," says Mr Tseng.
China does hear from conservative supporters of the kmt, which backs closer ties with China, although not unification. About 370,000 mainlanders married to Taiwanese live on the island. Those who vote lean kmt. Equally, at any moment there are a million Taiwanese in China, including 400,000 long-term residents. Tales abound of Chinese officials offering economic rewards to Taiwanese businessmen who endorse unification.
Wang Ting-yu, a dpp legislator who sits on the parliament's foreign affairs and defence committees, says that China's intelligence services gather information about Taiwan from "between 10,000 and 100,000" agents and informers. Fewer than 5,000 are professional spies, he estimates. Chinese informers might be Taiwanese gangsters on the hustle in southern China, or Taiwanese businessmen looking for favours. Mr Wang cautions that China may not learn much from its spies. (Taiwan's spooks are underwhelming when he asks about China, he notes, either because they do not trust parliamentarians or because "they don't know anything".)
A big danger is that ignorance leads to impatience. There are over 140 students from both sides of the straits at the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies at the University of Xiamen, a handsome port city with close geographic and cultural links to Taiwan. Chen Xiancai, a professor at the institute, says many arrive knowing little about the other side. Mainland students point to China's strength and ask: "Why haven't we unified yet?" His Taiwanese students retort: "Why are you in such a hurry?" The institute's scholars stand out for their professionalism, visiting Taiwan often to conduct fieldwork. The professor leads a dpp study centre opened within the institute in 2017. But he is cautious about describing its work, saying it is focused on building a database of academic papers. Still, he is sometimes berated by online nationalists, who complain that the dpp should be "exterminated", not studied.
Sherry Yu, a Taiwanese student in Xiamen, comes from a family that votes for the kmt. She wants a career in China but still laments that Chinese classmates-reared on jingoistic schoolbooks and censored news-cannot comprehend why Taiwanese would vote for the dpp or resist unification, insisting that they must simply want to humiliate China. Ms Yu thinks that Taiwanese just want to preserve their freedoms. When politics comes up, she often starts with "we", then sadly finds herself using "you" and "me". ?

摘要: On Feb 2019, rural China is in the grip of a long-feared catastrophe, an epidemic of African Swine Fever (ASF). China's first case was confirmed on Aug 3, 2018. It could ruin millions of pig-rearing smallholders. As of Jan 25 the Food and Agriculture Organisation, a UN agency, had confirmed 104 outbreaks of ASF in China and the culling of 916,000 pigs. Though the disease poses no threat to humans, there is no cure for infected swine and no vaccine against it. Here, how the ASF exposed the striking political weakness and isolation of China's small farmers is discussed.

全文文献: Headnote In most other countries, a swine-fever epidemic like China's would cause mass protests
UNTIL NOW links between social-realist cinema and "Peppa Pig", a sweet British-made animated television series for children, have been hard to spot. Then came "What is Peppa?", a beautifully crafted film about China's rural-urban divide, family ties and the sadness of old age that has accumulated hundreds of millions of online views over the past few days.
Officially, the six-minute short is an advertising trailer for a children's feature film made for the China market, "Peppa Pig Celebrates Chinese New Year". It is timed to cash in on the festival: day one of a pig-year in the Chinese zodiac falls on February 5th. Yet many grown-ups felt a pang of recognition as they watched the trailer's bittersweet, live-action depiction of Li Yubao, a gruff-butloving Chinese villager striving to please his city-dwelling grandson, notably by puzzling out the toddler's request for a Peppathemed gift. Filmed in the village of Waijinggou, in the dusty, hardscrabble hills that encircle northern Beijing, the short film is rather honest about modern inequalities. The mystery of Peppa's identity is solved by a village woman who worked in Beijing as a nanny. When grandfather and toddler meet, the child's eyes show fear at this wild-haired, over-loud old man, as well as excitement.
Still, the film leaves a lot out. A true work of social realism, if set in a farming village in February 2019, would acknowledge a reality that Chinese officials and state media are trying to downplay. Rural China is in the grip of a long-feared catastrophe, an epidemic of African Swine Fever (ASF). China's first case was confirmed on August 3rd 2018. It could ruin millions of pig-rearing smallholders in places just like Waijinggou. As of January 25th the Food and Agriculture Organisation, a UN agency, had confirmed 104 outbreaks of ASF in China and the culling of 916,000 pigs. Though the disease poses no threat to humans, there is no cure for infected swine and no vaccine against it. Vincent Martin, the agency's envoy to China, says eradication "may not be feasible in the short term", especially if wild pigs act as a reservoir for the virus. Russia offers ominous clues to the future. There an 11-year fight to control ASF has caused backyard pork production to fall by almost half, while large commercial farms which can afford strict biosecurity controls actually increased production. Such a shift would transform rural China, where almost half a billion pigs are produced each year, about 40% of them on small farms with fewer than 30 sows.
Transparency is a work in progress. Just a dozen years ago Chinese government vets talking to foreign colleagues sometimes refused to speak the names of illnesses aloud, coyly lamenting the arrival of "disease x" in "province y". Today China tells the UN about outbreaks and quarantine zones in which the transport of live pigs is banned and markets are closed. It has announced new bans on feeding pigs with food waste. But China is also intent on minimising the crisis. With new-year cooks busy planning porkheavy feasts, China's agriculture ministry assured the public on January 16th that ASF is having a "limited impact" on markets.
Dirk Pfeiffer, a vet and infectious-diseases expert at City University of Hong Kong, credits China with working hard to contain ASF. He notes that even rich European countries struggle with it. Still, he worries about why China's outbreaks are scattered as dots across the map rather than in clusters, as might be expected. This suggests either that the disease is being controlled with unusual success, or that outbreaks are being underreported.
Whether swine fever smoulders or blazes across China's farmcountry, it has already exposed the striking political weakness and isolation of the country's small farmers. In Europe, where farmers wield outsize political clout, the spread of ASF is blamed on government bungling, bringing calls for ministerial resignations. From Romania to Poland, Belgium and Estonia, pig farmers demanding compensation and stricter controls on wild boar have variously obstructed government vets, blocked motorways with tractors and threatened to dump animal dung on parliament. Governments have hastened to appease them. "I am one of you," a Polish minister told protesters pleadingly, citing his pig-farming past. To reassure farmers, Denmark is building a fence to stop wild boar crossing from Germany. On January 25th France said that it would mobilise troops to kill wild pigs. European farmers are used to deference. They often enjoy geographically concentrated voting power. Voters see them as defenders of cherished traditions. Tractors are a handy prop: governments fear sending riot police to attack anything that routinely appears in children's books.
Some farmers are more equal than others
Chinese breeders mount protests, too, for instance when corrupt officials steal land. But though ASF threatens many with financial calamity, this is not causing visible unrest. In part that is because the government works to stop citizens from banding together. And when it comes to public opinion, Chinese farmers are often on their own. Chaguan visited a farmer surnamed He, in the coastal province of Fujian. The 57-year-old grumbles about "hassle" from health inspectors. "We're not that afraid of swine fever, we're afraid the government's management is getting too strict," Mr He says, hosing manure from pens holding about 150 pigs. His three-year-old grandson scampers nearby, bells tinkling on ankle bracelets. Mr He makes a profit of up to 30 yuan ($4.46) per kilo on his pigs, not enough to pay for biosecurity measures ordered by officials. He sees no end to the ASF crisis. "Doesn't seem like there's much we can do." He is not puzzled that his children do not want his farm: the government "subsidises big farms, not small ones".
A bleak truth lurks in "What is Peppa?". Many Chinese feel for that film's hero, rattling around his half-empty village. They also understand why such places are abandoned. Tellingly, the trailer's emotional climax involves the grandfather relishing the big city with his family. For many small farmers in this country in a hurry, swine fever will hasten an end that was already in sight.

全文文献: Headnote China wants to defend the global environment. That will require it to embrace global norms
During the last ice age, when glaciers blanketed most of Eurasia, the peaks and plateaus of the Hengduan mountains in south-west China were spared. So many animals, birds and plants found a refuge there that, to this day, a quarter of China's mammal species live in that remote corner of Yunnan province. Strict laws protect a park created at the heart of the mountain range, embracing many varied habitats, from alpine woods filled with snubnosed monkeys to the parallel gorges down which thunder the headwaters of three great rivers, the Yangzi, Mekong and Salween.
Chinese officials are justly proud of this lovely place, and are clear that only high-quality administration can keep it safe. No detail was too small when they drew up a master plan for the park, now dubbed, not very poetically, the "Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Area". That plan included airborne and satellite monitoring to enforce rules, caps on tourist numbers and efforts to attract "high-income and well-educated visitors".
President Xi Jinping, China's leader, would surely approve. Mr Xi calls environmental protection a "battle" against all forms of pollution, from belching factory chimneys to official misdeeds. In May 2018, in a speech calling on China to build an "ecological civilisation", Mr Xi expressed confidence that strict enforcement of the law would help. He added that in this fight China would enjoy the great advantage of centralised, unified Communist Party rule.
For the world's tree-lovers, this is a complicated moment. It is a great advance that, for the past 20 years, the country has been working to protect the few Chinese forests that have survived centuries of over-exploitation, and planting new ones. But over the same period, China has also seen wood imports shoot up, from 8.8m cubic metres of forest products (excluding newsprint) in 1998 to 104m cubic metres in 2016. China has become the largest importer of wood, including rare tropical hardwoods, and the largest exporter of things made from wood, from furniture to flooring.
In the process, Chinese traders have snapped up timber from countries with governments that range from ineffective to outright wicked. In its most recent biennial review, the International Tropical Timber Organisation, an intergovernmental agency, could not hide its concerns about the effects of some Chinese imports. The Solomon Islands, a Pacific country, is shipping trees to China at such a rate that its forests may be exhausted within a decade, the agency lamented. Others worry about such producers as Papua New Guinea (png), China's largest single source of tropical wood. Chinese buyers brandish sheaves of permits when they import logs of taun, pencil cedar or kwila from the country. Alas, png's indigenous landowners and politicians, including a provincial governor, have called some logging permits a cover for illegal felling. An annual human-rights report on png by America's State Department names logging as an industry rife with official corruption.
Global Witness, a watchdog, has lobbied Chinese officials to make it a crime in China to import timber cut down in breach of another country's laws-following similar laws already in force in America and the European Union. The group has offered to teach Chinese businesses how to conduct due diligence on tropical timber, says Yin Beibei, a forestry expert with Global Witness. Firms typically offer two arguments in reply, says Ms Yin. The first is that it is too hard for them to assess the validity of permits issued in faroff lands. "Their second argument is: these are permits issued by a sovereign government and it's not our job to judge."
From a Chinese plywood-maker, that refusal to judge may sound shabbily self-serving. But the argument has pedigree. The principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries is a pillar of Chinese diplomacy. China calls its ask-no-questions approach a sign of respect for developing partners. In effect, China sees the way countries are run as a cultural matter; it would no more tell another government how to police its forests than suggest which god to worship. Western countries, by contrast, view such matters as a question of science. To them, clean government is like clean water: a boon that it is cruel to deny to anyone.
Moral relativism has been exceedingly convenient for China over the years. Only this month the foreign minister, Wang Yi, swatted aside charges that China is burdening African allies with too much debt, saying that Chinese loans merely respond to African demands for assistance, and always abide by local laws.
Yet there are signs that China's see-no-evil approach is bumping up against its ambitions to be an ecological exemplar. Forestry policy is a good place to see this. Luo Xinjian, an official at the National Forest and Grassland Administration, last year helped launch the Global Green Supply Chain initiative, a voluntary scheme to help Chinese timber firms ensure that imports are not just legal on paper, but are also sustainable. With margins tight, no single company can afford to be a green champion by itself, Ms Luo says. But she senses an "inner awakening" among entrepreneurs.
Global headaches, universal remedies
In the field of environmental protection, at least, China's government is also waking up to the importance of global rules and norms. Take that park in the beautiful Hengduan mountains. In 2003 China successfully secured unesco world-heritage status for it, in part by promising to protect such precious places not just for China's sake, but as "the commonwealth of all mankind". Mr Xi has called for China to become "deeply involved in global environmental governance", notably when it comes to climate change.
That is both good news for the world and a dilemma for China. For if saving trees in Yunnan, say, is a global good requiring strict oversight and the rule of law, why are trees in Papua New Guinea any different? A globally conscious China should promote clean government, environmental-impact assessments and monitoring everywhere. The world should thank Chinese leaders for stumbling into this logical position, then try to hold them to it. ?

全文文献: Headnote History shows the folly of China's self-defeating paranoia about Islam
IT IS A shame that so few Chinese remember General Bai Chongxi, a brilliant tactician during the war against Japan in 1937-45. He showed China that it is possible to be at once a patriot and a devoted Muslim. Bai was a complicated figure. A warlord capable of ruthlessness, he was also a reformer who wanted education to free his fellow Chinese Muslims from isolation and poverty. As a commander of Kuomintang (or Nationalist) troops, he was involved in massacres of Communists. Still, when Chaguan this week visited Bai's home town in Guangxi province, in the south, locals praised his victories over the Japanese. The Bai family mansion is a protected historical site. Austere and grey-walled, it sits amid rice fields and limestone peaks straight from a scroll painting. Its empty interior offers no explanation as to why Bai matters.
He was once one of China's best-known Muslims. Under the autocratic Nationalist rule of Chiang Kai-shek, Bai became head of a body representing the Hui minority, a diverse group of about 10m Chinese united by their Muslim faith. Often indistinguishable from China's ethnic-Han majority, their ancestors include Persian merchants and Central Asians imported by 13th-century Mongol rulers. The body headed by Bai, the China Islamic National Salvation Federation, recruited Muslim troops and made the religious case for war with Japan. It supported Muslim schools and job schemes for refugees. Bai encouraged Hui delegations to tour the Muslim world to seek diplomatic backing for China's war effort.
The general, who died in Taiwan in 1966, might have had useful advice to offer today. China is drawing up a five-year plan to "sinicise" Islam, as if the religion had been polluted by links to the outside world. In recent months Hui communities from Ningxia and Gansu in the north-west to Yunnan in the south have seen private Arab-language schools closed, mosques raided for providing "illegal religious education" and Islamic-style domes removed from buildings. Officials renamed the Aiyi river in Ningxia, a region that is home to around 2m Hui, because its name was "Arabic-sounding". In December Chinese media reported that Gansu and six other regions were abolishing local standards for halal, or Muslim-approved, foods, in the name of fighting extremism and foreign influences. If such measures stir thoughts of repression in the farwestern region of Xinjiang, where as many as a million Muslims from the Uighur minority have been sent to re-education camps, that is no coincidence. Ningxia officials recently toured Xinjiang, pledging to learn from its "good practices".
The Hui have faced suspicions of disloyalty before. In 1280 a Mongol emperor of China, Kublai Khan, outlawed halal food and other Islamic customs, reputedly incensed because Muslim merchants had refused a banquet he offered them. In a forthcoming essay for the Rubin Museum in New York, Johan Elverskog of Southern Methodist University describes a panic that gripped the Qing dynasty in the 1760s. Amid reports that Arab-educated Islamic hardliners were stirring up trouble, local officials were told to report all Muslim misdeeds. A new law deemed three or more Muslims found with any weapon to be criminals. "As might have been expected," the professor writes, officials inundated the Qing court with reports of dangerous Muslims, prompting still-harsher laws and further radicalisation of the Hui. In time, rebellions followed.
Yet long before Communist bosses vowed to regulate Islam, Hui elites crafted what amounted to their own sinicised versions of Islam, advocating political loyalty to China's rulers alongside eternal allegiance to Allah. One age of co-operation, about 400 years ago, generated the "Han Kitab", texts that reconciled Confucianism and Islam, teaching Muslims to obey any emperor who upheld a social order aimed at moral perfection. Jump to the 1920s, and a reformist scholar, Wang Jingzhai, promoted the phrase aiguo aijiao or "loving our country is as one with loving our faith", which hangs in Chinese mosques. The expression had authority because it was both patriotic and Islamic. It is ascribed to the Prophet Muhammad. Wang translated it after studying in Mecca.
Withdrawing from the world
If it is a shame that Bai Chongxi is largely forgotten, it is heartbreaking to find how defensively he is remembered in places that know his name. Bai's kinsfolk still live in villages near Guilin city. Chaguan found some of them preparing ducks for curing ahead of Chinese new year. Alas, even mild questions about whether their ancestor protected the Hui caused disquiet. "Just stop talking," hissed a woman to an old man surnamed Bai, who had begun answering as he salted duck neck-bones. "We are very happy and there is no ethnic discrimination," said the woman.
In nearby Jiu village, home to a century-old mosque, Wang Yisehakai, the ahong or imam, blandly praised General Bai as a pious man who prayed in the heat of battle. He added, improbably: "The most important thing about Bai is that he cared for his parents." Asked about politics, Mr Wang said his community's only ills come from lost faith. He grumbled that fewer than a dozen elderly Hui pray each week at his mosque, which looks like a Chinese temple with its tree-filled courtyard and curving roof.
At the Bai family mansion, Chaguan bumped into four male travellers from Ningxia, sporting straggly beards, long robes and the white prayer caps of pious Hui. One, surnamed Zhou, hailed General Bai's strong faith but scorned any link between Islam and patriotism. "We are put on Earth to have our faith in Allah tested. We are not interested in politics at all," he said. "Such things as aiguo aijiao are spoken only by those who don't understand."
Such a historically ignorant vision of Chinese Islam would appal Bai Chongxi, as would official attacks on halal rules. The general was a pragmatist. During wartime rows about dietary codes he proposed creating Hui units with their own food so they could get on with fighting. Communist bosses seem not to care for such approaches. They prefer sullen submission to shared loyalties.

全文文献: Headnote Why young Chinese are sporting 1,800-year-old fashions
Like teenagers the world over, Chen Bolin, a Chinese university student, feels a need to belong. Unlike many of his peers, Mr Chen has found a spiritual home: China of the Wei and Jin dynasties, about 1,800 years ago. So deep is this bond that on special occasions he wears flowing, wide-sleeved robes inspired by thirdcentury dress. One moment of connection stood out, when he wore robes to a museum in Shaoxing, the eastern city where he studies. There he found a sculpture depicting sages from the Wei and Jin era. His own clothes were "exactly like theirs", he recalls happily. He saluted the statues and told them: "Dear ancestors, I've heard so much about you. It is my good fortune to see you today."
The teenager developed his passion at high school in Pingliang, perched in the hills of Gansu, an inland province. Though a rather small, sleepy spot, Pingliang is home to a Han culture association. Such clubs are spreading fast. They celebrate the Han ethnic group to which more than nine out of ten people in China belong.
Enthusiasts claim that a million Chinese, mostly youngsters, regularly wear Hanfu, or robes inspired by traditional Han dress. The unplanned emergence of any social movement in China presents Communist bosses with a choice: scramble to the front of the parade and claim to lead it, or ban it. For now, the parade continues. State media hail Hanfu as a welcome complement to calls from President Xi Jinping to revive traditional culture and values. In April 2018 the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, a recruitment channel for party members, declared a first "Traditional Chinese Garment Day". The league urged young Chinese to don ancient finery to demonstrate "cultural confidence" to the world. There was a caveat, however. The league's commemorative day honours what it calls Huafu, or "Chinese dress". That encompasses not only Han traditions but those of China's 55 official ethnic minorities, from such places as Tibet, Inner Mongolia or the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. The league's caution reflects wariness about overt Han chauvinism, which threatens official narratives about a unified, multi-ethnic China.
In truth, clumsy Communist propaganda extolling national unity arguably helped create a hunger for Han traditions. At big party events, ethnic-minority delegates typically attend in brightly coloured folk costumes trimmed with silks, furs or jangling silver jewellery, even as Han delegates appear in Western suits and ties. This both patronises minorities and renders the Han an invisible nationality-representatives of a sort of generic modernity.
As Mr Chen shares his story, the slight, bespectacled teenager is wearing robes of lilac and white, embroidered with blue clouds, an outfit he says is Jin-dynasty day-wear. All around are thousands of fellow enthusiasts attending a Hanfu cultural festival held annually in Xitang, a quaint, canal-side town near Shanghai.
Hanfu wearers vary in their devotion to historical accuracy. Mr Chen has brought along a classmate whose look combines a blackand-white military uniform, 21st-century sneakers and an air of faint embarrassment. "I think this is Han dynasty," the classmate mumbles, when asked. The colours are more Ming, says Mr Chen, gently correcting his friend's dates by about 1,100 years.
Enthusiasm counts for more than precision. On this sunny festival weekend a local Starbucks boasts baristas in toga-like robes, a warrior in chain-mail queuing for coffee, and outside, a Taoist priest in a tunic and cloak outfit he calls "a bit of messed-up fusion". Luling Manman, an author invited to the festival as an expert on ancient etiquette, defines Hanfu as "all forms of clothes we Han people have worn over the course of 5,000 years". Others take a narrower view, describing a tradition cut cruelly short when the last ethnic-Han dynasty, the Ming, was overthrown in 1644. In European terms, that is like wrangling over a school of fashion that supposedly began in Neolithic times and flowered in the Middle Ages, and may or may not have ended during the English civil war.
Since the Hanfu movement emerged in the early 2000s, some members have framed it as a way to restore Han customs suppressed by ethnic Manchu warriors who conquered China from the north and ruled as emperors of the Qing dynasty from 1644 until 1911. Han nationalists scorn such "Chinese" traditions as tightfitting qipao dresses or high-collared jackets precisely because they are derived from Manchu, Qing-era fashions.
The visible Hans
At the Xitang festival, it should be said, brooding nationalists are outnumbered by youngsters having uncool, goofy fun. Blushing students giggle their way through a lesson in ancient dancing. Earnest, robe-wearing young men take photographs of each other playing the flute or practising archery. Children take part in a fashion show, swishing perilously along a catwalk in too-long finery.
The festival organiser is Vincent Fang Wenshan, a Taiwanese lyricist behind some of the most famous Mandarin pop songs of recent times. A dapper 49-year-old in black embroidered robes, Mr Fang urges younger enthusiasts to eschew Han chauvinism and to be open to modernised Hanfu. He sighs that some purists will not tolerate any dress not found in ancient wall paintings, and draws a wistful comparison with Japan, where traditional customs and modern culture co-exist easily. Wearing a kimono on a Japanese bus causes no astonishment, notes Mr Fang, lamenting that a gap of several centuries separates Han traditional culture from the modern world. He would like to see Hanfu fans bridge that gap.
Historians might quibble with some of Mr Fang's details. Plenty of Han traditions actually survived under the Qing. The country's sharpest break with tradition came during the first decades of Communist rule, when leftist zealotry made it safest to wear blue and green Mao suits. But that is to take the Hanfu movement too literally, perhaps. Look past the invented costumes and the dodgy history, and something simpler and more poignant appears: a whole country yearning to know where it belongs. ?

全文文献: Headnote China is obsessed with opponents in the West. It should worry more about disillusioned ex-friends
To fieldmice, rabbits and voles, every shadow overhead is a hawk until proved otherwise, condemning them to lives of needless panic. Chinese nationalists seem intent on ignoring that lesson from nature. Behind rising tensions with the West, they see dangerous anti-China hawks everywhere. Specifically they feel under attack from hardliners with President Donald Trump's ear, who are intent on keeping a rising China down.
Rather than hawks scheming to contain China, jumpy nationalists should be worrying about a different group: Americans and Europeans who were once advocates of engagement, but have been disappointed by illiberal, aggressive choices made by Chinese rulers. They are not so much hawks as unhappy ex-doves.
That runs counter to an official Chinese narrative that casts China as the peace-loving victim of Americans with a cold-war mindset. In the words of a Chinese speaker at a recent policy forum: "[Cold-warriors'] feet have entered the 21st century but their heads are stuck in the 20th century." This narrative is used to explain the trade war begun by Mr Trump. It is applied to the recent arrest in Canada of a Chinese businesswoman, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant linked to an alleged sidestepping of sanctions on Iran (see Business). The arrest of Ms Meng, chief financial officer of Huawei, a telecoms giant, and also the daughter of the firm's founder, has angered public opinion in China. Dismayingly, many responses skip past the legal rights and wrongs of the case to denounce what they call an outrageous, political attack on a Chinese national champion.
More vitriol is poured on anti-China hawks than on Mr Trump in person, in part because China hopes to strike a deal with America's president. That message discipline is striking but unhelpful. It is true that Mr Trump lends half an ear to anti-China hawks who think communist rulers incapable of changing. But for Chinese leaders, a trickier challenge is posed by ex-doves readying one last attempt to make them change. These diplomats, academics, politicians, executives and entrepreneurs from across the West are not America First unilateralists. Plenty are internationalists, worried that China is co-opting institutions such as the un and the wto to make them safe for authoritarianism, state-backed capitalism and other threats to a rules-based order. Above all, these ex-doves agree that 20 years of patiently cajoling China to change has not worked.
Lines between economic competition and national security are blurring. Western officials fret about Chinese hacking attacks on the home-country servers of big companies, only some of which have been reported. They murmur about Chinese investors visiting obscure startups or university researchers, offering to buy very specific technologies. That makes such officials more willing to endorse the idea that the West should insist on reciprocity in dealings with China-an idea they once heard as code for protectionism. They worry that China is taking advantage of a Western openness that now feels naive. That does not make them anti-China. It makes them ex-doves who read secret intelligence reports.
America's China-policy machine, involving various branches of government and members of both parties in Congress, wants to change tactics. Instead of writing wishlists of specific actions- here a new regulation, there a business licence-the machine wants to talk about high-level principles. That means telling China that it cannot rise at America's expense. It involves explaining that granting foreign firms market access means little if the government is their regulator and (via state-owned enterprises) their competitor. Such scepticism may overshadow a reported Chinese offer to supplant a self-reliant industrial policy, Made in China 2025, with something more foreigner-friendly. Rather than haggle over every concession, America's machine wants China to explain how it will change.
In recent months Chinese and American officials talked past each other, as China resisted a substantive discussion about how it operates. A worrying lesson from Western governments' humanrights dialogues is that China is brilliant at turning debates about principles into empty talkfests. It complicates matters that America's machine answers to a president who seems so uninterested in principles and norms. On December 11th Mr Trump told Reuters, a news agency, that he would intervene in the Department of Justice investigation of Huawei and Ms Meng if it was good for national security or for reaching a China trade deal. Aghast, Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, urged America not to "politicise the extradition process or use it for ends other than the pursuit of justice." Soon after China threatened Canada with "serious consequences" for arresting Ms Meng, Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat turned analyst for the International Crisis Group (icg), a think-tank, was detained in Beijing. icg said he had been picked up by secret state-security police. China's foreign ministry accused icg of lacking operating permits. A China-based Canadian entrepreneur who has led tours to North Korea, Michael Spavor, is also missing after contacts with Chinese authorities, Canadian officials said on December 12th.
No-go for the status quo
At his worst Mr Trump makes his trade war sound like a rent renegotiation, through which he wants to make China pay more for access to the valuable property known as the American economy. But Mr Trump is not the only actor in China policy. Lots of decisions never reach his desk. Indictments of alleged Chinese spies and hackers are said to be on the way, along with tighter visa rules. Wise tech-firms are examining whether sensitive supply chains that run through China are politically sustainable. Tensions may worsen quickly if China sticks with a state-dominated growth model. If so, expect accusations that anti-China hawks have achieved a long-planned victory. In truth, brokenhearted advocates of engagement with China will have failed.

摘要: Coldly calculated interests, not affection, are binding China and Russia closer. At first Hunchun's residents are wary of discussing why their home town-a drab but friendly city of fewer than 230,000 people-is the terminus of a high-speed rail line from Changchun, the nearest provincial capital. Hunchun is a good place to hear how ordinary Chinese and Russians talk about each other, even in a city where they meet every day. Despite growing exports of Russian natural gas, timber and other commodities to China, trade lags behind targets set by national leaders, says Xing Guangcheng of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research institute. Hunchun may be a fine place to see how underwhelming Sino-Russian friendship can be at ground level. Chinese and Russians still view each other with striking cynicism: just ask residents of Hunchun about trains to nowhere.

全文文献: Headnote Coldly calculated interests, not affection, are binding China and Russia closer
THE HIGH-SPEED train from Changchun to Vladivostok would be a fine symbol of Sino-Russian friendship, if someone would finish it. The line's Chinese leg is a modern marvel: a silk-smooth ride through a blur of birch trees and red-roofed farms. Then the line ends at buffers in Hunchun, a border city near Russia.
At first Hunchun's residents are wary of discussing why their home town-a drab but friendly city of fewer than 230,000 people-is the terminus of a high-speed rail line from Changchun, the nearest provincial capital. The line, which cost 42bn yuan ($6bn), opened in 2015. Public records show that the surrounding province, Jilin, invited Russia to help lay the track as far as Vladivostok, the Russian Far East's largest port. Russian selfishness scotched that plan, Hunchun's residents mutter. "Russia said, 'If you want it, you can build it,'" alleges a Chinese business owner. It will take 20 years for high-speed trains to cross that border, he sniffs.
Hunchun is a good place to hear how ordinary Chinese and Russians talk about each other, even in a city where they meet every day. Russian signs hang in shops and hotels. City clinics profit from Siberian medical tourists (Russian teeth are "not so good", says a dentist, delicately). Local seafood-importers turned to Russian suppliers after UN nuclear sanctions limited Chinese access to North Korean crabs. But suspicions lurk. Lang Yulin, a seafood dealer, blames Russian bureaucracy for the five days it takes goods to reach Hunchun from Vladivostok, 300km away by road. Worse, Russian partners will never work late or at weekends "no matter the financial hit", he grumbles.
There is a patriotic edge to Hunchun's main tourist site, an hour's drive away at Fangchuan. It marks a three-way border with North Korea and Russia created in i860 when tsarist forces took advantage of imperial China's weakness and swiped a swathe of coastal land, leaving Jilin province landlocked and the sea a tantalising 15km away. That would never happen now, ventures a tourist from Sichuan province: "China is a strong country."
Economic ties between the two neighbours have long been disappointing. Despite growing exports of Russian natural gas, timber and other commodities to China, trade lags behind targets set by national leaders, says Xing Guangcheng of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government research institute.
Mutual coolness explains some of this slow growth. Mr Xing has devoted his working life to studying Russia. Still, when asked to explain trade volumes, he unhesitatingly contrasts the work ethic in China, a crowded, hyper-competitive country lacking in natural resources, with the languid pace of life in Russia, a country blessed with land and mineral riches to spare. He describes scenes of bafflement when Chinese farmers rent land in the Russian Far East, rising before dawn and working until after dark. When they pause for swift lunches in the fields, Mr Xing says, Russians circle them and stare, asking, "Why do you work so hard?" For their part, Siberian farmers think Chinese farmers use too many chemicals.
One barrier to co-operation used to involve fears about Chinese migrants overrunning the Far East, where just 6m Russians live. In the 1990s nationalist politicians lobbied against visa-free entry for Chinese citizens, thundering about Chinese men taking Russian wives. Fears were eased by a Russian government study, some four years ago, that found 600,000 Chinese living in Russia, mostly in the European west, rather than the millions commonly supposed. Still, the public is easily inflamed. Recently, Russian newspapers have fulminated against Chinese firms logging Siberian forests.
Russian elites long viewed China with racially tinged scorn, says Alexander Gabuev of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, a thinktank. He recalls a Russian official, just before the financial crisis in 2009, scoffing at China's supposed modernity, calling it a Potemkin village whose big GDP reflected "millions of poor people who will work for a bowl of rice".
Such rudeness leads Westerners to doubt whether the two countries can grow very close. "I see little in the long term that aligns Russia and China," America's defence secretary, James Mattis, said in September. Wiser Chinese and Russian heads argue that ties are stronger because they are based on coldly calculated interests. In Soviet times, China signed deals as a junior partner, says Mr Xing. Today logic dictates whether Sino-Russian projects happen because relations are more normal, he suggests: build a fast train to sparsely peopled Siberia and who would take it?
Present arms
Hunchun may be a fine place to see how underwhelming SinoRussian friendship can be at ground level. But with the right catalysts, state-to-state relations deepen fast. That has been especially evident since 2014, when Russia's annexation of Crimea provoked Western sanctions that left the Kremlin turning to China in search of capital, technology and markets, says Mr Gabuev. In September 3,200 Chinese troops trained alongside 300,000 Russians in eastern Siberia: a remarkable show of trust between countries that fought a border war in 1969. Russian arms sales to China had slowed in 2005 after spy scandals, including China's theft of designs for a Russian fighter jet. They are booming now. A rising China will soon not need imported weapons, so Russian arms-makers are rushing to cash in. China does not want a military alliance-it views Russia as alarmingly hot-headed. But the pair work at the UN to promote a worldview that puts sovereignty and iron-fisted order ahead of universal rights. China copied Russia's law curbing foreign non-governmental organisations. Russian spooks are fascinated by Chinese surveillance technology.
Chinese and Russians still view each other with striking cynicism: just ask residents of Hunchun about trains to nowhere. But a shared cynicism about the world unites their governments-and survives the complicating factor of an amoral American president. For some neighbours, friendship is not the point.

摘要: "We do not speak. We let the cultural relics speak!" declare the ambiguously worded signs around China's most interesting history museum: the Jianchuan Museum Cluster, a sprawling, astonishing memorial to China's 20th century. Taken literally, the notices are a request not to be noisy. They remind elderly couples or red-scarved school groups to whisper as they wander through the 33-hectare campus with its dozens of museums housing three-dimensional recreations of life under Japanese occupation in the 1940s, or during the "Red Age". That is the museums' tactful name for the 1960s and 1970s--above all the Cultural Revolution, the decade after 1966 when Mao Zedong unleashed terror on his own country, pitting neighbor against neighbor, students against teachers, children against parents and Red Guard mobs against officials whom Mao despised.

全文文献: Headnote A remarkable museum network offers a chance to remember, if not judge, China's dark past
"WE DO NOT speak. We let the cultural relics speak!" declare the ambiguously worded signs around China's most interesting history museum: the Jianchuan Museum Cluster, a sprawling, astonishing memorial to China's 20th century. Taken literally, the notices are a request not to be noisy. They remind elderly couples or red-scarved school groups to whisper as they wander through the 33-hectare campus with its dozens of museums housing three-dimensional recreations of life under Japanese occupation in the 1940s, or during the "Red Age". That is the museums' tactful name for the 1960s and i97os-above all the Cultural Revolution, the decade after 1966 when Mao Zedong unleashed terror on his own country, pitting neighbour against neighbour, students against teachers, children against parents and Red Guard mobs against officials whom Mao despised. More than a million lives were lost, and many more ruined. Centuries-old temples and libraries were smashed to so much rubble and firewood.
The signs also carry a symbolic meaning that no Chinese visitor can miss. In a country where historical studies are a tool of the Communist Party's control, not an invitation to debate, the Jianchuan museums take another path. Quietly and sympathetically, without bossy sloganeering, they let visitors explore and share memories of the recent past, as jogged by a unique collection of some 8m artefacts. These are museums that show, rather than tell.
Taken as a whole, the exhibitions comprise the largest private-sector museum in China. They are the work, essentially, of one man, Fan Jianchuan, a government official turned property tycoon. His museums are divided between two sites. First came the campus outside Anren, a country town in the soft, green lowlands of Sichuan province. In June Mr Fan opened another complex in the Yangzi-river city of Chongqing. There he hosts Chaguan for a fiery Sichuanese lunch in offices above an old munitions factory built into a cliff. Restless and plain-speaking, he has the shaved head of a monk and the torso of a wrestler, squeezed into a green т-shirt with a motto that pays homage to his army years on the border with Russia. He talks of patriotism, calligraphy and the commercial headaches of running museums. Everything returns to his collector's love of the authentic. "The real thing, this," he says, giving the massive steel lunch-table a loud slap. "Second world war."
China has no monuments that explicitly remember victims of the Cultural Revolution. The party has declared that period a disaster while asserting that Mao's achievements far outweigh his mistakes. Until this year, a history textbook used in Chinese middle schools devoted three pages to the Cultural Revolution. In January social media erupted over news that that decade of turmoil is now covered in six paragraphs of a chapter headed "Arduous Exploration and Achievements in Development".
Mr Fan's museums pick no fights with a party whose accomplishments he notes with pride, and of which he is a member. His exhibits are sincerely patriotic. They have been garlanded with official praise and awards, notably for displays depicting the Japanese occupation. Over the course of a rainy couple of days this reporter shared the museums at Anren and Chongqing with flag-toting school parties and a platoon of uniformed police. Many visitors bring grandchildren, wanting them to comprehend a past that is so recent, and so alien.
At times the museums' architecture hints at traumas that hundreds of millions of Chinese endured together. One entrance hall is a claustrophobic horror, and not by accident. Long, high-ceilinged and windowless, it is illuminated by red floor panels and-at the far end of the room-by a screen showing footage of hysterical Red Guards greeting Mao. No caption hints at a rebuke of the Great Helmsman. The museums do not challenge party injunctions about how the past should be remembered. Instead, they use relics and physical spaces to test the boundaries of what may be recalled.
Some objects evoke happy nostalgia. Spotting a sewing machine in a display about life in the 1970s, a man cries to his wife, daughter and mother-in-law: "My mother had one just like that! She made clothes, trousers and everything!" Other exhibits recall hardships. One museum in Anren is devoted to the nearly 18m urban youngsters who were banished to the countryside for years of ploughing, hauling manure and digging ditches instead of being educated. Propaganda photographs show such "sent-down youths" beaming as they toil, but nearby the diaries of some who endured the experience are displayed in glass cases. They speak of loneliness and longing. A visitor explains why he brought his son and four other teenagers: "It is necessary for them to know this. Their lives at home are too easy," he murmurs.
Who owns the past?
The museums capture the paradox of a country that combines rising prosperity with ever-tighter political control. Private property-such as the relics collected here-enjoys stronger protection than at most times in China's history. Yet Communist bosses remain unwilling to cede control over private thoughts, including the memories that such exhibits might evoke. Drawing the wrong lessons about the past can prompt charges of "historical nihilism", an offence that sees museums punished and careers blighted.
Now 61, Mr Fan does not want China to forget hard-won lessons about past mistakes. But he calls it reasonable to wait another generation before debating who was right and who was wrong half a century ago. He has kept tons of historical papers in storage. If someone was raped or purged and never wants to speak of it, what right does he have to bring that up, he asks? "Why can't China just tell its history straight? Because there's no sure way of telling it straight. Everyone was involved," he says with emphasis.
China's complexities make Mr Fan reluctant to lecture. Instead he builds: his dream is another 50 museums, preserving still more relics for his fellow Chinese. One day, there will be a lot to say.

全文文献: Headnote Why Western governments are at last complaining about China's new gulag
FEW GOVERNMENTS send ambassadors to China to be brave about human rights. Envoys to Beijing are scholars of realism, their fine minds applied to a delicate task: managing profitable relations with a deep-pocketed, unapologetic dictatorship.
It is, therefore, a big deal that at least 14 ambassadors from Western countries, led by Canada, have come together to confront China over its mass detentions of Muslims in the far-western region of Xinjiang, most of them ethnic Uighurs. Officials say the purpose is to stamp out extremism. In a letter leaked to Reuters, a news agency, the ambassadors have asked to meet Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party's boss in Xinjiang. A hardliner transferred from Tibet, Mr Chen oversees a gulag into which perhaps a million Uighurs have been sent for "transformation-through-education", many for indefinite periods without trial.
Millions more endure surveillance by facial-recognition cameras, smartphone scanners and police patrols at every turn. Some must host officials as houseguests, sent to assess their loyalties. China calls these measures vital after terrorist attacks carried out in recent years by Uighur fanatics.
It is revealing that China seems startled to find itself under ambassadorial scrutiny. It has some reason to be. Chinese officials cynically believe-and will say in private-that Western leaders and envoys raise human rights out of a sense of reluctant obligation, in order to placate activists and public opinion back home. This time, however, the charge is being led by ambassadors, not the public. Envoys in Beijing admit that most people in their countries have never heard of Xinjiang or the Uighurs. They also concede that some folk back home might have mixed feelings were they to learn that the Uighurs stand accused of terrorist leanings.
Protesting Muslim bans, wherever they are found
Xinjiang's agonies are hardly a vital national interest for the first countries to sign the draft letter-Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, joined by the European Union. Instead, a Western diplomat sees a stark test of principle, asking: if we do not protest when a million people are detained without trial, when will we speak out?
That points to another reason for China to be startled. It is years since human rights seriously disrupted Chinese foreign policy. China won a big victory in 1994 when America's then president, Bill Clinton, abandoned his previous commitment to make China's access to American markets conditional on its human-rights record. "We have reached the end of the usefulness of that policy," Mr Clinton mumbled, before expressing hopes that China would be changed by engagement with the world. For reasons both selfish and noble, other governments fell in line behind that same plan: a bet that a prosperous China would surely converge with an international order crafted by Western powers after the second world war, based on global trade, universal rights and the rule of law.
China has not converged. In the meantime, the post-war rulesbased order has rarely felt so fragile, thanks in part to the election of populists such as President Donald Trump. That fragility explains why once-meek governments are finding their voices. It is why Xinjiang crashed onto the agenda of the Stockholm China Forum, a twice-yearly gathering of American, Chinese and European ambassadors, diplomats, scholars, politicians and business leaders, hosted recently by Sweden's foreign ministry and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a think-tank. A speaker predicted that Xinjiang's woes would "explode in public opinion".
Normally dispassionate, the forum saw sharp exchanges about Xinjiang. Speakers described hearings in Washington at which farm-state senators, who once cheered trade with China, used phrases like "Orwellian" and "concentration camps". It was noted that China's high-tech police state appals Europeans, who dread government surveillance, especially in Germany. Defenders of China accused the West of hypocrisy, saying: "This is not Guantánamo." (True: there are only 40 inmates in Guantánamo.)
To be sure, the West is not united over how to defend the rulesbased order. eu signatories to the ambassadors' letter are mostly from northern Europe. From the China-led "16 plus one" grouping of former communist countries in Europe, the only signatory at the time of publication was Estonia. Australia, a big exporter to China, signed. New Zealand, another big exporter, did not.
America's position is hard to predict. In a recent China-pounding speech, Vice-President Mike Pence was stern about Xinjiang. A bipartisan group of members of Congress wants Chinese officials to face sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act, a law targeting human-rights abusers. But America's envoy in Beijing did not sign the Canadian-drafted letter. Nobody can guarantee that Mr Trump will uphold his government's line when he sees his counterpart, Xi Jinping, later this month at a G20 meeting in Argentina, rather than beam that China is smart to be tough on Muslim terrorists.
The wider world is not united. Turkey, which feels bonds of kinship with Uighurs, a Turkic people, was the only Muslim country to rebuke China at a recent meeting of the un Human Rights Council in Geneva. Other Muslim countries, many of them recipients of Chinese loans, praised China's human rights.
Global argument over Xinjiang is likely to get fiercer. Horrible things are happening. International investors are growing jumpy about stakes in firms selling security kit used there. It matters that China's talking points are outrageously cynical. Chinese lines tested in Stockholm include the claim that the camps protect the rights of Uighurs raised in remote, mainly Muslim areas. The camps offer modern employment skills, it was explained, and the right-guaranteed in China's constitution-to choose your own religion or to believe in none. More propaganda like that, and ambassadors will not be the only ones asking hard questions.

摘要: Hu Jinzhou, a professional player of computer games in China's multibillion-dollar livestream industry, is featured. "Boss Cai", as Hu is known on online, has for the past year played computer games in a glass-walled studio in Shanghai for eight hours a day, six days a week, showing off his virtual fighting skills and wisecracking to fans, 140,000 of whom follow him on social media. Add together Boss Cai's salary from Chuxin, the agency that employs him, payments from Internet platforms that broadcast his performances and his share of the online gifts that followers send him (the equivalent of tips thrown into a busker's hat), and he can make 50,000 yuan ($7,190) in a month--more than many former classmates earn in a year. His parents are proud of his earning power--though his father needed assuring that his son had not become an exotic dancer.

全文文献: Headnote A small-town boy, trying to make it big on China's internet
BEFORE HU JINZHOU began his climb into the foothills of fame, as a professional player of computer games in China's multibillion-dollar livestream industry, he was a schoolboy tearaway. He got into playground fights, tried to sell his textbooks to classmates and sneaked out after dark for some online gaming.
Back then, Mr Hu's reluctance to conform was a drama played out on a small stage. "Our hair went white trying to straighten him out," sighs his stepfather, Cai Hongbo, recalling nights spent hunting for the boy in the internet cafés of Dangyang, a factory town in Hubei, a central province. Quick-witted and popular, if not with teachers, Mr Hu shrugged off efforts to control him. "We'd get him to kneel..." recalls his mother, Zhao Aiying. "...To write letters of apology," chips in her husband at their foot-massage parlour on a busy market street, where traders sell roasted nuts, vegetables of the brightest green and fish from the nearby Yangzi river. Their son embarked on a life of menial, migrant jobs.
Today he is 20 and his roguish charm is a marketable commodity, offering substantial rewards but also risks on a national stage. At its most commercial, China's internet can look like online life elsewhere. It is not. Behind China's Great Firewall of internet censorship, even online entertainment must bow to political diktats.
"Boss Cai", as Mr Hu is known on online, has for the past year played computer games in a glass-walled studio in Shanghai for eight hours a day, six days a week, showing off his virtual fighting skills and wisecracking to fans, 140,000 of whom follow him on social media. Add together Boss Cai's salary from Chuxin, the agency that employs him, payments from internet platforms that broadcast his performances and his share of the online gifts that followers send him (the equivalent of tips thrown into a busker's hat), and he can make 50,000 yuan ($7,190) in a month-more than many former classmates earn in a year. His parents are proud of his earning power-though his father needed assuring that his son had not become an exotic dancer. "He thought it was the type of livestream where you dance and shake your bum," explains Boss Cai. "I said there were boys who livestream, too."
Still, it is not a conventional career. Some children in Dangyang have seen Boss Cai online and are wide-eyed at his celebrity. Their parents can be sniffier. "They'll say, there aren't a lot of geniuses made by playing games," his mother reports.
Parental disapproval helps explain why few livestreaming stars come from so-called first- or second-tier cities, such as Beijing or provincial capitals, admits Dai Qianwen, Boss Cai's real-life boss at Chuxin. Big cities supply much of the livestreaming audience. Take a subway or grab lunch in Chongqing or Guangzhou, and a startling number of those around will be gazing at a smartphone. Many young men will be watching livestreamers playing such games as "Honour of Kings" or "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds". There are female gamers, though livestream firms mostly try to attract female viewers with video of young women singing, dancing and cracking jokes in winsome simulacra of teenage bedrooms. For that homelike feel, Chuxin's female stars broadcast from company apartments. (Creepily, a female livestreamer's income can come mainly from two or three big-spending male fans.) But after measured doses of online fun, big-city kids are expected to hit the books and cram for college.
Many livestreamers come from fourth- or fifth-tier cities with few opportunities, says Ms Dai. In addition to placing recruitment advertisements online, Chuxin sends scouts to schools and internet bars to find talent as young as 16. The firm prefers to recruit unknowns who can be moulded into stars, she says. Lank-haired and slumped in padded swivel-chairs, young performers at Chuxin's studios in Shanghai are kept supplied with witty lines, snacks and energy drinks. Some take naps on narrow beds in a corner. A regional link can be a crowd-pleaser. Girls from Sichuan are famously pretty, says Ms Dai; north-easterners are funny; and the mangled vowels of the Hunan and Fujian accents are cute.
Only room for one party host round here
There are greater risks with online fame than the disapproval of neighbours. In October Yang Kaili, a livestreamer with tens of millions of followers, was detained for five days for singing a few bars of China's national anthem in a "disrespectful" manner online, a criminal offence. She apologised and promised to embark on a course of patriotic education. To China's rulers, it is useful when citizens are distracted from stressful lives by smartphones showing larky videos or wholesome livestreams. But those seeking prominence of any sort-including producers of real-world or virtual content-must know their place. Chuxin reminds its stable of young performers that big stars have been ruined by online comments made when they were small fry, but which were unearthed years later. The big Chinese livestream platforms warn Chuxin when sensitive topics are trending online, and will shut down performers who stray. Even a newcomer like Boss Cai feels pressure. "The minute you get famous, all eyes are on you," he says carefully.
The result is a heavily policed version of non-conformism. Whenever Boss Cai is playing, his audience includes Chuxin staff assigned to manage him, monitors from the livestream platform that hosts him, unknown agents of the government, and his mother back in Dangyang (at least once a day, she admits). Asked why she watches her son on her smartphone while he engages in virtual combat, Ms Zhao quietly explains: "I just miss him."
Boss Cai calls his life both painfully tiring and fun. Is it lonely, he is asked? His bravado fades for a moment. "Exceptionally lonely," he answers. In China, individualism has a cost.
In last week's column, "Respecting their elders", we identified the boss of Medical Care Service's operations in China as Grace Meng. In fact her surname is Wang. Sorry.

全文文献: Headnote Japan's expertise in old-age care becomes a source of soft power in China
Amid the stress and sadness of choosing an old-age home for her husband, it took Li Wangke, a retired academic, a while to realise why one facility was so good at reawakening his playful, chatty side. She had visited other homes that had fine food and lavish amenities, reflecting the affluence of the couple's southern Chinese home town, Guangzhou. But one newly opened home stood out for easing-at least somewhat-the symptoms of the disease ravaging his brain. Rather than pampering her 83-year-old husband, its staff assessed his rare neuro-degenerative illness, then with warmth and firmness pushed him to do as much for himself as possible. They cajoled him to talk, exercise and even play ping-pong. He seems a "different person", says Ms Li.
After several visits she discovered that the home's methods had been imported from Japan, a former wartime foe that older Chinese are commonly thought to detest. Her husband, also a retired academic, moved in full-time in late October. "It's from here that I learned that Japan takes really good care of its elderly," she says.
The home is a joint venture between a Chinese state-owned investor and Medical Care Service (mcs), Japan's largest operator of dementia-care homes. mcs opened its first Chinese facility in Nantong, a city near Shanghai, in 2014. A third opened in the northern port of Tianjin last month. It has plans for more in Beijing, Xi'an and even in Nanjing, the site of a Japanese wartime massacre, memories of which plague the relationship to this day.
China's needs are vast. Degenerative brain diseases are too often confused with mental illness. Sufferers are shut away in family homes with unskilled helpers, typically migrant women from the countryside. Some families share guilty tales of sending relatives to psychiatric wards, where they are strapped to beds and fed pills. More than 10m Chinese are estimated to have some form of dementia. "That is a big, almost frightening number," says Akira Wate, the general manager of mcs's home in Guangzhou.
By 2030 China is projected to have 23m dementia sufferers-almost the population of Australia. During a visit to China last month by Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, the two governments named old-age care as an area for co-operation. China and Japan are trying to edge closer in these stormy, Trumpian times. One bond involves demographics. With almost one in nine citizens over 65, China is at the point on the ageing curve that Japan hit in 1987. It has a lot to learn from its Asian rival's experience.
Chinese old folk and Japanese care-home operators have discovered revealing things about each other. mcs was full of confidence when it opened its 106-bed home in Nantong. Half a year later, just six beds were filled. For Asian neighbours that revere the old, China and Japan turn out to differ-a lot. Notably, China is an exceptionally low-trust society. But bonds of family duty are stronger than in Japan, say mcs's bosses, noting the frequency of visits and the solicitude of residents' children.
In orderly Japan, entering a home is straightforward, says Mr Wate. An older person shows signs of dementia, facilities are recommended, their child might visit one, admission follows. In China, suspicion is the starting-point, with the domestic news full of stories of fatal fires or bullying at nursing homes. Unprompted, Ms Li relates how her daughter, a banker, warned her against taking private firms' promises at face value.
Chinese customers worry constantly about being ripped off. When it entered China, mcs set its prices high and built single-bed rooms to Japanese standards, offering the privacy and calm that pensioners in Japan demand. But Chinese clients wanted company and the lively din known as renao, relates Grace Meng, mcs's boss in China. They questioned the emphasis on doing things for themselves, grumbling that, "I paid money, so you have to do everything for me," Ms Meng says. Her firm changed its model, building shared rooms, lowering prices and offering day rates to demonstrate its methods. The home in Nantong is now profitable.
Historical distrust of Japan has not been a big problem. mcs neither boasts of nor hides its origins. As well as a Chinese scholar's study and mahjong tables, its home in Guangzhou has a Japanese roof garden with benches, stone lanterns and an artfully trained pine. A few residents refuse to speak to visiting Japanese executives, admits Mr Wate, who is of mixed Chinese and Japanese ancestry. Most are pragmatic, associating Japan with good service.
Family dynamics cause more headaches than nationalism. In Japan, generous government insurance covers most care-home costs, giving old folk much autonomy. In China many in need of care must either sell property or ask children for help. Average monthly fees at mcs's home in Guangzhou are 14,000 yuan ($2,224)-more than a typical pension. That makes entering a home a collective decision by as many as four or five family members. The elderly also need convincing. Many want to preserve their savings to help the young. Because trying to stay at home is the norm, the average age of mcs's residents in China is 85, about a decade older than at its dementia-related facilities in Japan.
The best sort of technology transfer
Still, China is quicker to embrace change than outsiders might suppose. Ms Li recalls the traditional line: "Raise children to care for you when you get old." But her children have demanding jobs, and she hates asking them to take too much time off. Nor are hired helpers the solution. When her husband loses control of his bowels, no hired helper will clean him, she says matter-of-factly. Such helpers are "very impatient". The Chinese once believed that only bad children send their parents to care homes, she concedes. "We don't think that way anymore."
Rather few Chinese will ever be able to afford Japanese-style homes, it is true. That does not make their expertise irrelevant. If China's old enemy can raise the profile of kindly, attentive dementia care, that alone would be a historic, neighbourly act. ?

全文文献: Headnote To understand China's vision for globalisation, think of it as a giant sub-prime lender
Since its emperors first wrangled with distant barbarians, China has practised unsentimental diplomacy. Not much has changed, to go by its dealings with Brazil and Venezuela as the two Latin American countries struggle with political crises.
On his noisy, populist path to victory, Brazil's hard-right president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro, cast China as a menace. "The Chinese are not buying in Brazil, they are buying Brazil," the former army officer growled on the stump. He was referring to China's snapping up of oilfields, mines, ports, giant dams and power grids. Since 2000 Chinese direct investment in Brazil has amounted to nearly $5obn. At times, Mr Bolsonaro's gripes echoed those of the Trump administration, far to the north. In October Mike Pompeo, the American secretary of state, accused Chinese state-owned firms of "predatory economic activity" in the region. Mr Pompeo's predecessor, Rex Tillerson, had urged Latin Americans to reject "new imperial powers" like China, bent on extracting natural resources while issuing unpayable loans. Candidate Bolsonaro seemed to agree. In February he pointedly visited Taiwan, the democratic island that China wishes to control. Back home, he said a planned privatisation drive might "leave Brazil in Chinese hands".
China's response to Mr Bolsonaro's victory was an olive branch. The government's English-language mouthpiece to the outside world, China Daily, expressed "sincere hope" that when he takes charge of the world's eighth-largest economy in January, Mr Bolsonaro will view China ties rationally.
Contrast that forbearance with China's impatience when Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro visited Beijing in September, trailing clouds of flattery. On paper Mr Maduro is a fellow socialist (he calls China "big brother"). It matters more that his corrupt, violent and inept regime has bankrupted a country blessed (or cursed) with vast oil wealth. When China advanced into the Western hemisphere, Venezuela was a beachhead, taking more than $62bn in Chinese loans. Now Chinese officials privately mutter that Venezuela's rulers have no grasp of market forces.
The regime's founder, Hugo Chávez, was fond of quoting Mao Zedong to charm Chinese visitors. In the same vein, Mr Maduro, a man not known for subtlety, began his recent trip by visiting Chairman Mao's mausoleum in Tiananmen Square, bowing and calling the embalmed tyrant a "giant of revolutionary ideas". But his reward was a few modest oil deals, aimed at reversing a production slump that makes it harder for Venezuela to repay its debts. China even nagged him in public to pursue economic reforms and strengthen property rights. Mr Maduro claimed to have signed agreements worth billions. China discreetly briefed diplomats in Beijing that this was previously committed money.
China's restraint, tolerating Bolsonarian bluster while ignoring Venezuelan sycophancy, does not signal impotence. Its clout has grown astonishingly, notably in the region's south. Five years ago, for South Americans, the leading outside power was the United States, says Argentina's ambassador to Beijing, Diego Ramiro Guelar. "Today it is China. Not as a projection into the future. Now."
China is the region's second-largest trade partner after America, and the number one trade partner for Brazil, Chile and Peru, notably buying soyabeans, iron ore, oil, copper and meat. Its loans are often at high interest rates and are tied to contracts for Chinese firms. They fund both useful projects and vanity ones for local despots. China's lack of scruples helps autocrats in other ways. This summer a Chinese diplomat responsible for Latin America praised Venezuela and Cuba for conducting elections "smoothly"-one way of describing fake polls in which opposition is stifled.
Yet the specific charge that China is a neo-imperialist power is misplaced. In Latin American history, empires tend to have ideological preferences, and are willing to foment coups or send in troops to enforce them. China is at once less sinister and more cynical than that. A decade ago, leftist governments from Brazil to Ecuador, Argentina and Venezuela welcomed China's arrival. But when the left imploded in country after country, China did not leave. Benjamin Creutzfeldt of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies has cross-referenced Chinese investments, loans and high-level visits with left- and right-wing election wins. He found no visible patterns.
Bearing greenbacks, not little red books
Instead China stands out for its willingness to invest in risky or corrupt places with few alternative sources of capital or of cheap, robust technology. Its approach might be called sub-prime globalisation. At best, sub-prime lenders are non-judgmental sources of second chances. At worst, they are see-no-evil profiteers, and vulnerable to backlashes. China is a bit of both.
When Mr Maduro falls, some critics predict a painful reckoning for his Chinese paymasters. Chen Dingding of the Intellisia Institute, a foreign-policy think-tank based in Guangzhou, retorts that friendship is not China's bottom line. When familiar faces lose power, his country's offer to successors is "you may not like us, but you may want to deal with us," he says. Mr Chen sees China's push into Latin America as "70-80%" driven by economics, with longterm influence-building explaining the rest.
Antonio Ledezma, a Venezuelan opposition leader and former mayor of Caracas, says his people are "saddened" that China is propping up their country's dictatorship. Because China's loans were not approved by a legitimate parliament they are illegal and will not bind a future democratic government, he adds. Some $20bn of debt to China has yet to be paid back. Strikingly though, Mr Ledezma talks of renegotiating those loans, not repudiating them. Venezuela will have no problem striking deals with China in the future, he stresses, as long as they are legal. In this Chinese century, there are no permanent enmities nor friendships. It will not be a sentimental age. ?

全文文献: Headnote What a new bridge between Hong Kong and the mainland says about"One Country, Two Systems"
A great phalanx of Chinese politicians turned up this week to open the world's longest sea-crossing bridge, connecting Hong Kong with the mainland city of Zhuhai and the former Portuguese colony of Macau. The throng of Communist grandees, who strode into the opening ceremony with President Xi Jinping at their head, was fitting, because the project makes more sense as a political symbol than as a transport link.
Nine years in construction, 55km long and wildly over budget, the bridge consists of a series of six-lane bridges and tunnels, winding between man-made islands across the Pearl River delta. It was hailed at the opening by Han Zheng, a Chinese deputy prime minister, as a boost for the principle of "One Country, Two Systems". Under that ingenious slogan, in the late 1990s, Communistrun China took back Hong Kong from Britain and Macau from Portugal, with a promise to preserve their rumbustious, neon-lit capitalist systems for 50 years. Mr Han's tribute was a bit disingenuous. No obvious free-market forces conjured the bridge into existence. Sceptics in Hong Kong call it an expensive way to bind their city and its 7m people to the motherland.
Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, dutifully called the bridge a chance for her city to play a more active role in the development of mainland China, and in particular the "Greater Bay Area", Team Xi's name for the region spanning Hong Kong, Macau and the southern province of Guangdong. She also declared the bridge an engineering marvel, which it is.
But many Hong Kongers are not sure what it is for. Nifty routes to China are welcome. A high-speed railway between Hong Kong and the next-door metropolis of Shenzhen has been a hit since opening in September. There is less demand for new links to Macau, a gambling and tourism enclave, and still less to Zhuhai, the Chinese city that adjoins it. Most travellers will ride buses over the bridge, even though these may often be slower than the ferries that already criss-cross the delta. Private cars will need to collect separate permits from Hong Kong, Macau and Zhuhai to cross the bridge, a process that takes over two weeks. Hong Kong's share of the bill for the project reportedly stands at HK$i2obn ($i5bn).
Centrally planned follies are not the only example of Hong Kong scrambling to please the central government. In a first for Hong Kong, officials recently refused to renew the visa of a Financial Times editor, Victor Mallet, after he moderated a talk at the Foreign Correspondents' Club by a local politician who advocates independence for the territory. Chinese officials later said the event crossed the "red line" dividing free speech from subversion.
A human-rights report published in April by the us State Department expressed concerns about Hong Kong government actions with a "chilling effect" on free speech. It noted moves to criminalise actions mocking China's national anthem, and the disqualification of pro-independence candidates in Hong Kong's semi-democratic elections. The British government said the rejection of Mr Mallet's visa undermines the freedom of the press, and called confidence in Hong Kong's rights and freedoms "an essential component of its future success".
Westerners have been trying these arguments on China since Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of the day, started offering "One Country, Two Systems" in the early 1980s. The formula was adapted from an idea floated past the government of Taiwan a few years before, as a way to sweeten the prospect of reunification with the Chinese mainland under Communist rule. In 1984 Britain's foreign secretary told Chinese counterparts that Hong Kong was "a Ming vase, an object of priceless value" that had to be handed over without a slip. Alas, the two sides never agreed what exactly the phrase "One Country, Two Systems" was intended to protect. Deng took an unsentimental view of Hong Kong as a place made valuable by free markets and a strong, unelected government. If socialism were imposed on an unwilling Hong Kong, he said in 1984, it would lead to "turmoil", if not armed conflict.
Deng, no liberal, seemed to accept some of the openness that makes Hong Kong tick. Describing its future, he talked of a city run by technocrats and business leaders who, as long as they loved China, should be allowed to criticise communism. He foresaw Taiwanese envoys in Hong Kong, free to argue their island's merits "because the Communist Party cannot be toppled by criticism".
Taking liberties
Officials are less relaxed now. Zhang Xiaoming, director of the central government's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, on October 18th complained to bosses from Hong Kong news outlets that some residents of their city "still adopt an antagonistic attitude towards the mainland's political system".
Defenders of Hong Kong's pluralism typically urge China to have more confidence in its grip on the city, and not squeeze so hard. They may be missing a big change. Among Chinese officials, paranoia increasingly combines with hubris. Deng talked of preserving Hong Kong so that China could gain access to foreign capital, technology and management techniques. "Without Hong Kong, we would not be well informed," he said in 1989. Today's China is vastly more confident, says Anson Chan, who served as chief secretary of the Hong Kong government under the British and for the first four years of Chinese rule. Though China's leadership is not monolithic, she says, "The hardliners' view is, who needs Hong Kong? The rest of the world will come to us on bended knee."
Hong Kong remains important to China as a global financial centre. That tempers Communist leaders' irritation at grumbling from the city and their alarm at the rise of "Hong Konger" as a local identity, over "Chinese". But as confidence in an all-Chinese model grows, the perceived value of tolerating two systems shrinks. Hong Kong feels that. Taiwan, too. China should re-learn Deng's self-knowledge, or risk divides too wide for any bridge.

全文文献: Headnote China is misreading the politics of Western anger about globalisation
The era of populist politics in the rich world is hard work for China. Its leaders generally dislike change in foreign capitals, preferring to deal with old friends or devils they know. Young leaders, in particular, can be bumptious, and in need of training in how to avoid annoying China. On the upside, turmoil in Western capitals offers new ways to put foreigners in their place. A European envoy in Beijing describes how Chinese officials greet visitors who raise such issues as the rule of law or political freedoms. Rather often, he reports, Chinese hosts cite the financial crisis that gripped Europe and America in 2008 (but which largely spared China) and the rise of populist parties. "They say: 'We have been using our system for millennia, and your system doesn't work.'"
Delightful though it is to gloat, on balance China is getting this populist moment wrong. Chinese leaders are too cynical about elections in the democratic West, and about the lessons that even messy campaigns can offer. They are not cynical enough about their own authoritarian system, refusing to see how it induces a sort of democracy-blindness. Even well-informed officials and scholars misread political dynamics around the world.
The really perilous response involves disdain, and a serene confidence that voter anger is evidence of domestic failure in the West. Precious few Chinese voices question the political sustainability of a global economic order from which China has profited so copiously, claiming to be a developing country with the right to subsidise domestic firms and close markets to foreign rivals, while growing to become the second largest economy on Earth.
China is right that big, proud Western parties of government have had a rough few years. The invasion of Iraq is sometimes added to the list of self-inflicted wounds that China avoided. But too often China misreads the underlying causes of Western woes.
China got the American election of 2016 wrong several times over. Beforehand Chinese officials and diplomats barely concealed their horror at the thought of a President Hillary Clinton. They saw the former secretary of state as a scold on human rights and a hawk on national security. They mistook Donald Trump for a New York businessman without fixed beliefs, not realising that he has believed in one big thing for 40 years, namely the merits of a good trade war. After his election China decided Mr Trump was a blowhard who could be bought off by purchases of American goods. Now they ascribe his rise to American decline, and to the rage felt by a superpower as it is overtaken by a harder-working, more disciplined China. In September China's State Council turned this sore-loser theory of Trumpism into a 71-page white paper.
The white paper on us-China trade sets out to prove with numbers and graphs that unemployed Americans are wrong to believe China unfairly stole their jobs. It argues that China is being scapegoated for America's own domestic policy failures. It notes that America lacks re-training schemes for laid-off workers and is stingy about redistributing wealth. It upbraids America for refusing to sell China pricey bits of sensitive high technology, which would close the trade deficit nicely. "No job lasts for ever," the paper chides, adding that multinational firms, American investors and consumers gained handsomely overall from trade with China. As economic analysis, the white paper has strong and weak points. As a political response to Mr Trump, it is frighteningly obtuse.
Chinese officials have matching theories about political upheaval in Europe. They can sound somewhat admiring of European social democracy and its systems of redistribution. But when pondering European populism, they talk of a refusal to embrace the hard reforms with which China is grappling. Chinese officials are just as suspicious when they hear foreign political and business leaders assert that if China does not address such issues as overcapacity in its steel industry then it risks stoking populist anger abroad. Their hunch is that the West dislikes losing and will use any pretext to hold China back.
The upside of disaster
Many Chinese critiques of Western populism are rooted in truth. But cynicism is leading China astray. For recent elections have not just been humiliating for mainstream Western politicians. They have also been painfully instructive in valuable ways. Elites-at least those capable of introspection-learned how little they are trusted by voters who did not prosper amid rapid globalisation. Thoughtful elites further learned that aggregate economic gains do not replace the human need to feel useful, respected and heeded, as individuals. In a lesson of especial relevance to China, big Western parties have learned that, during economic booms, it is easy to overestimate mass support for elite policies.
Some years ago Fritz Scharpf, a political scientist, made a useful distinction between two sources of political legitimacy. Adapting Abraham Lincoln, his theory describes polities that gain "input legitimacy" by electing citizen representatives and then holding them directly accountable, ie, that offer government of and by the people. Others claim "output legitimacy" by enacting successful policies; ie, they offer government for the people.
Chinese leaders inhabit a universe that revolves around output legitimacy. They justify one-party rule by pointing to such achievements as economic growth and social stability. Though concerned with public opinion and eager for discreetly gathered feedback, they are appalled by chaotic, fact-free elections in the democratic world. Yet Western elites were taught the opposite lesson by their defeats by populists-namely, if voters do not feel listened to, displays of technocratic expertise are not enough.
This is more than a trade dispute. Increasingly China and the West disagree on the legitimacy of each other's complaints. China's leaders do not have to respect Mr Trump and his ilk. They should respect the forces that he rode to victory, which were building for years. If not, this crisis will outlast him, and them.

全文文献: Headnote Why stressed-out Chinese fall for melodrama about life in the imperial court
A BIT surprisingly, one of the best things about the "Story of Yanxi Palace", a television drama about an 18th-century emperor that has broken Chinese viewing records this year, is watching concubines being rude to eunuchs. Even less predictably, the particular rudeness-combining scorn, resentment and a dash of fear-offers insights into how Chinese people cope with life in today's ruthless and unequal society. An early scene shows the Qianlong emperor's chief eunuch, a tubby, squeaky dimwit, bustling into a silk-draped waiting-room with an order for the harem. Return to your quarters, he announces, the emperor is working late. "What? His majesty is sleeping alone again?" grumbles Noble Consort Gao, a boo-hiss villain. "Let's go," she tells her fellow concubines, stalking past the eunuch without a glance. "What else is there to wait for?"
"Yanxi Palace" is a gorgeously costumed fantasy, filled with poisonings, betrayals and young women competing for the Forbidden City's great prize: being bedded by the emperor. "Join the army, you might as well become a general," as one ambitious recruit to the harem chirps. The show is driven by female characters, including a kind but sickly empress, murderous concubines and-at the heart of the 70-episode epic-Wei Yingluo, a quickwitted, justice-seeking maid, who rises to become Qianlong's beloved consort. The formula is wildly popular, drawing 700m livestreaming views on the drama's best single day, in August.
Yet that night-time scene in the harem reflects some bleak realities of court life. The eunuch is ridiculous, and obsequious to high-ranking concubines. But he is also terrifying. For the concubines live only to please his master, the emperor, an absolute ruler in whose name the guilty and innocent alike are shown being jailed, executed or exiled without hope of appeal. The Forbidden City is a crimson-walled tyranny, filled with spies. Noble Consort Gao's drawling insolence in the face of rejection is, in the end, bravado. She is privileged, cosseted and ready to hurt those below her in the pecking order. But in this system she has no individual rights. And she does not challenge its rules.
Many Chinese might mock attempts to extract political lessons from "Yanxi Palace" or other recent Qing dramas drawing huge audiences, such as "Ruyi's Royal Love in the Palace". Yet Chaguan quizzed visitors to a museum in the city of Changchun, housed in a palace built by Japanese occupiers when they installed the last Qing emperor as the puppet ruler of north-east China from 1932-45. Such dramas just use history as a backdrop, scoffed two students, Taylor Wu and Linda Zhang. They are really stories about "modern life", they added, whether that means love stories or concubines seeking promotions.
The students are on to something. Watching bored, paranoid concubines waiting for the emperor's summons, the penny drops: this is a workplace drama, and these employees are failing a performance review. Young maids in a palace dormitory, torn between small acts of kindness and infighting, could be teenage workers at an electronics plant. Even bejewelled dowagers sound like scolding parents from 2018, with one calling a daughter "gutless" for failing to ask Qianlong for a promotion.
Imperial dramas have reflected the politics of their time since they first hit Chinese tv screens in the 1980s. Film-makers study what Communist Party ideologues call the "main melody", a musical term they have borrowed to describe the core political ideas upon which creative sorts are encouraged to riff. "tv Drama in China", a study published by the Hong Kong University Press, elegantly catalogues permitted themes. Historical dramas from the 1980 s stressed the weakness of the last Qing rulers. In the authoritarian aftermath of the Tiananmen democracy protests, such shows praised 18th-century emperors as stern patriots whose ruthlessness supposedly preserved national unity. "Yongzheng Dynasty", a drama from 1999, recast the unpopular Yongzheng emperor as a flinty corruption-fighter. That reminded contemporary viewers of Zhu Rongji, a crusty reformer who was prime minister at the time, Ying Zhu of the City University of New York has noted. By 2007 viewers were glued to "The Great Ming Dynasty 1566", a cynical drama about rampant corruption.
As years passed market forces joined Communist propaganda chiefs as a second boss. Early shows were dominated by male characters and mostly watched by men. Today's tv drama audience is 70-80% female and mainly from smaller cities, says Lei Ming of abd Entertainment, an audience-analysis firm. Viewers typically watch on smartphones, he adds. Their favourite part about the show is talking it over afterwards with friends.
The leading man in "Yanxi Palace", Qianlong, is something of a cipher: a stern autocrat who finds his harem a chore. Chinese pundits have debated whether the show is a feminist tale about strong women, or a retrograde saga about women who survive by obeying and pleasing bossy men. It is both. It is a reflection of the country today, a chauvinist place full of strong women.
Just trying to make a living
In a fast-rising China, life is hard and filled with obstacles and anxiety, says Wang Xiaohui, chief content officer at iQiyi, the Netflix-like entertainment company behind "Yanxi Palace". Mr Wang describes today's main melody. The masses (and the party) like stories in which subordinates are loyal, kindness is rewarded and wickedness punished, and in which young people who work hard can succeed. Mr Wang hails the women in his drama for an "independent spirit" that resonates with viewers. Outsiders may note that such spirits do not always seek to reform or change a society. Getting ahead can be enough.
A recurring theme of "Yanxi Palace" is that the Forbidden City is a place of harsh rules, but that rules keep chaos at bay. Such obedient resignation suits China's modern rulers well. With 15bn cumulative downloads, this will not be the last of its kind.

全文文献: Headnote It was hypocrisy for America to "welcome" China's rise. Yet honesty may be worse
IT TAKES nerve for a White House official to pick a fight with China's government and claim that Confucius gave him the idea. Matt Pottinger, senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, did just that with a speech at the Chinese embassy in Washington on September 29th. Citing Confucian strictures on the dangers of hypocrisy, Mr Pottinger urged his audience to take seriously the Trump administration's decision to brand America and China as competitors. To ignore such an evolution in relations was to invite miscalculations, he added, dropping into Mandarin to recite the Confucian counsel: "If names cannot be correct, then language is not in accordance with the truth of things; and if language is not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success." It was quite a moment. Read between the lines. A Trump aide was declaring an end to years of warm words about welcoming China's rise.
Confucian scholars call this doctrine the "rectification of names". As trade tensions deepen between China and America, both powers are being careful with their name-calling. Chinese officials avoid stoking the fires of nationalism. They have not rebuked Mr Trump personally, instead chiding America for "trade hegemonism" and other abstruse offences that are hard to chant at protest rallies. As for Mr Trump, he recently conceded that his (unreciprocated) habit of calling President Xi Jinping a friend had run its course, after his announcement of tariffs on up to $200bnworth of Chinese exports. "He may not be a friend of mine any more, but I think he probably respects me," Mr Trump said.
Western relations with China have long whiffed of hypocrisy. Politicians mumbled about welcoming China's rise when they meant that they did not know how to stop it. Such leaders hoped instead to manage the impact of that soaring growth so that, on balance, China, their countries and the world would all be better off. Chinese officials, in turn, continue to talk of seeking "win-win co-operation" with America, even as they privately accuse Team Trump of plotting to contain their country. The same officials boast of open markets but, when Western governments raise specific cases of brutal treatment of foreign firms, blandly reply that they cannot get involved in commercial disputes.
Double-speak, then, has provided cover for many abuses. An optimist might conclude that more candour is just what relations need. There are two problems with that theory. One involves confusion about what a more honest America might want. The second involves the degree to which China's foreign policy-and its presentation to the Chinese people-is built on foundations of hypocrisy, and might totter if those were to be removed.
American confusion can be taken first. Within Team Trump, hawkish but practical China-hands like Mr Pottinger present candour as a way to shore up an American-led, rules-based order. Competition is not a four-letter word and America can still compete as a champion, Mr Pottinger said at the Chinese embassy. "We're adapting our game to China's style of play." If that sounds like a gentleman athlete warning opponents that their cheating has been rumbled, Mr Trump's candour is more cynical. His is the logic of a sports promoter who assumes that every match is rigged and lives by only one rule: thatrivals should not disrespect him. On October 1st Mr Trump said-as he has before-that he does not blame China for "ripping us [off] for so many years". Instead he chided predecessors for failing to extract enough from China for the privilege of trading with America. China "wants to talk very badly", Mr Trump added happily. But he will wait, the better to extract terms that favour American workers.
Chinese leaders are visibly unsure how to cope with such extortion. Their caution suggests that, in part, they fear a public backlash at home that could tie their hands when deal-cutting. Here, the role of hypocrisy becomes complicated. It is a given among many China pundits that the country lives on the brink of hair-trigger nationalist outrage. The reality is more nuanced. A large and cleverly designed study of Chinese public opinion by Kai Quek of the University of Hong Kong and Alastair Iain Johnston of Harvard University tested scenarios involving a fictional conflict over the Japanese-controlled, Chinese-claimed Senkaku islands, during which China's leader publicly threatened military action against Japan then backed down. Each scenario was presented to a different panel of some 450 people. Several excuses for a climb-down mollified those polled, notably ones in which China's leader variously agreed to UN mediation, argued that the Chinese were a peaceful people, explained that the economy would be hurt by war, or proposed economic sanctions as an alternative to armed force. One scenario proved less palatable. Told that China's leader was backing down in the face of American military threats, respondents disapproved, many strongly.
The doctrine of the mean
A stickler for Confucian principles of correct naming might quibble at frequent claims by Chinese leaders that theirs is an exceptionally peace-loving country. So might neighbours which, in living memory, China has invaded, threatened with invasion, bullied or robbed of South China Sea reefs. Still, Messrs Quek and Johnston, in their paper "Can China back down?", show that such claims did allow a fictional Chinese leader to climb down, whereas American threats tied his hands. As Mr Quek puts it: "Hypocrisy can have a positive impact."
These are unsatisfying complexities. The two countries' relations are long overdue a bracing dose of honesty. But reducing China's bargaining space is not automatically in America's interests. And Mr Trump's preferred form of candour-an amoral, might-makes-right cynicism-may be the least help of all.

摘要: Many countries are questioning the benefits of globalization. The nastiest rows occur when immigration enters the equation. Citizens chafe against the free movement of goods and capital, but most of all people. China's leaders speak as globalization's champions. Pres Xi Jinping declared to African leaders in Beijing this month that "with open arms, we welcome African countries aboard the express train of China's development." Yet if Chinese leaders like the idea of goods and capital rushing at express-train speed, they have never embraced the idea that people should move freely, let alone dream of acquiring hybrid, part-Chinese identities. Even marriage to a Chinese national brings no special residency rights. Here, the limits of Chinese' openness is discussed.

全文文献: Headnote An African enclave in Guangzhou reveals limits to Chinese openness
RICHARD GATHIGI, a Kenyan entrepreneur, has lived in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou since 2005, oiling the wheels and gears of the low end of globalisation with doses of human trust and acuity. When an African friend had a small but urgent order-450 safety vests bearing the logo of the un mission to Somalia-Mr Gathigi knew a factory that could help, though he wishes he had asked a higher price. "The un has a lot of money," he explains cheerfully, stabbing at a late-night plate of fish and rice in the Xiaobei district of Guangzhou, a hub for African traders. In a world without contracts, confidence is his currency. Nearstrangers in Africa trust him to inspect goods ordered online from China. He is an old-timer in Guangzhou's cramped, fluorescentlit trading malls. Chinese bosses are cautious about tricking him.
Still, Mr Gathigi is no pioneer of multiculturalism, China-style. He is one of thousands of Africans who work in the city, though their numbers have shrunk since 2014 when officials said 16,000 Africans were living in Guangzhou. He respects his host country. Now 44, he wants his teenage children to study at Chinese universities, after being brought up in Kenya. But in 13 years he has not learned Chinese, visited the Great Wall or eaten at a local's home. He first saw China in his 30s, he notes. "Most of my values were formed. Apart from business, I don't have much interest."
Listening to Mr Gathigi, he could be an 18th-century "supercargo" or trade agent, sweltering on the riverfront to which Westerners were confined, back when the city was known as Canton. Non-Chinese then were forbidden even to learn the language. Mr Gathigi thinks that China still prefers foreigners to visit, trade with locals, then leave. America and Europe make it difficult for Africans to obtain visas, he observes, but once in the rich world migrants can easily overstay and live in the shadows, doing work that Westerners shun. "With the Chinese it's the opposite," he adds. "They make it easy to enter but very difficult to stay." After all these years, he lives on a business visitor's visa that must be reset with a run to Hong Kong or Macau every 30 days.
Many countries are questioning the benefits of globalisation. The nastiest rows occur when immigration enters the equation. Citizens chafe against the free movement of goods and capital, but most of all people. China's leaders speak as globalisation's champions. President Xi Jinping declared to African leaders in Beijing this month that "with open arms, we welcome African countries aboard the express train of China's development."
Yet if Chinese leaders like the idea of goods and capital rushing at express-train speed (ideally with Chinese drivers at the controls), they have never embraced the idea that people should move freely, let alone dream of acquiring hybrid, part-Chinese identities. Even marriage to a Chinese national brings no special residency rights. A decade ago Guangzhou's diversity prompted articles and books by Westerners pondering whether this was multiculturalism. After watching African men marrying Chinese women, Gordon Mathews of the Chinese University of Hong Kong wondered whether the world might see a "Chinese Barack Obama" (not soon, he concluded). More recently journalists and scholars have debated whether China is displaying racism with campaigns to build a "clean, safe and orderly" Guangzhou, during which street traders have been swept away, restaurants catering to foreigners ordered to close by 10pm and districts like Xiaobei flooded with police checking passports.
Obtuse or callous views of ethnicity are dismayingly common in China. Racial assumptions run like an electric current through some official vows to clean up Guangzhou. But many Africans take a fatalistic view. Emmanuel Ojukwu, a prominent Nigerian trader, has no issue with the twitchy police. "Some people were taking the opportunity to conduct bad business, trading drugs and other criminality," he says. Kiema Moussa, from Burkina Faso, describes strict visa rules as a business cost. Muslims attract no special scrutiny, he says, chewing on a street-stall kebab after Friday prayers at Guangzhou's ancient Huaisheng mosque. Chinese officials know "straight away" if a country suffers terror attacks or an outbreak of disease and may refuse visas as a result. "It's still worth coming," he shrugs.
Building world cities, not melting-pots
Ali Mohamed, a Somali freight forwarder, is a rare African with a Chinese passport, having spent long enough in Hong Kong to earn citizenship. Jaws drop when he joins the domestic immigration line at Chinese airports. He has seen many Africans leave. Officials want a "modern" Guangzhou focused on global finance and commerce, he says. But he insists they are "not targeting Africans". Mr Mohamed, who is 50, has moved around Asia all his life. Although proud of his new passport, he is keeping an eye on Chinese factories opening in Africa and on businesses moving to Vietnam. "We are Somali nomads. Where it rains, we go."
Western politicians and ceos often brag about their countries' or companies' long relationships with China, fondly imagining that Communist leaders have a sentimental side. Chinese officials promote schemes offering permanent residence to a few, exceptionally qualified foreigners. But at the ground level of globalisation, the Africans know that outsiders stay on sufferance.
Your columnist watched a packed evangelical Christian prayer service at a dowdy central business hotel, tolerated because only holders of foreign passports may attend. One worshipper, Velile Sibiya, a medical student from South Africa, thinks Chinese leaders have done "magically well" by persuading so many citizens to work hard, think alike and inhabit a "little cocoon of peace". She is unsurprised that people are not encouraged to become Chinese by naturalisation. "Citizenship gives you rights, it gives you a voice. I think they are protecting this world that they have created." Though grateful for her training in China, she is not planning to stay. Good guests know when to leave.

全文文献: Headnote The curious role of the Global Times, China's tabloid attack-dog
FEW countries have invested more man-hours in suppressing awkward facts than China. Internet censors employ more foot-soldiers than some armies. Propaganda officials are so strict that, lest instructions faxed to newsrooms leak, they issue some orders to squelch stories by telephone, to be recorded by hand.
Yet the rules do not bind all equally. The Global Times is a jingoistic tabloid that tackles topics shunned by rivals, even though it is a subsidiary of the Communist Party mouthpiece, the important-but-turgid People's Daily. In July it reported that Liu Xia, the widow of the Nobel-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo, had left for Germany. Recently it has ignored orders to downplay tensions with America and has offered defiant candour about Xinjiang, a restive western region turned police state. There is mounting evidence that hundreds of thousands ofMuslims from Xinjiang's Uighur minority have been sent to re-education camps for such acts as public prayer or reading history books. Even as Chinese spokesmen denied the camps' existence, the Global Times, in its English-language edition, acknowledged "counter-terrorism education" among Xinjiang residents and work to "rectify" the thinking of imprisoned extremists. Whether the way Xinjiang is run violates human rights "must be judged by whether its results safeguard the interests of the majority in the region", said the Global Times in August. Its editor, HuXijin, tweeted that Xinjiang had been saved from becoming "another Chechnya, Syria or Libya".
Strikingly, rather than claiming that Western journalists misreport Xinjiang, the Global Times prefers to troll them, accusing foreign correspondents of hoping to "profit" from negative China coverage, while asserting that the Western press is "nowhere near as influential as it once was" and gleefully noting Mr Trump's attacks on "fake news". If that sounds familiar, it should. This populist, nationalist age suits the Global Times and its Trumpian instinct that the best defences are brazen ones: coolly conceding opponents' facts while attacking their motives and standing.
It is not fashionable in China to take the Global Times seriously. Mention it at dinner with Chinese intellectuals and fireworks follow. They deplore its sabre-rattling towards Taiwan and Japan, and its deep reservoirs of grievance (this week the paper peddled a largely confected tale accusing Swedish police of brutalising some rowdy Chinese tourists). In 2016 a retired Chinese ambassador compared it to an angry toddler. Xiang Lanxin of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, a former Global Times columnist who left because of its nationalism, has written that it would be a "great shame" if history were to equate the tabloid with Der Stürmer, a hate-filled Nazi rag. On Weibo, a microblog site where Mr Hu has 15.7m followers, critics call him "Frisbee catcher", ie, a lapdog chasing stories tossed his way. Foreign diplomats wonder whether the paper floats trial balloons for party hardliners, or simply pursues profit.
Asked that question at his office, in a drab block on the People's Daily campus in Beijing, Mr Hu suggests a bit of both. "If the People's Daily and the Central Publicity Department don't like me, they can assign me elsewhere with just one order," he says. Yet his paper lives off circulation and advertising, so "the party and readers are both my gods." The paper's Chinese edition sells 1.5m copies a day, says the managing editor, Yao Li. The English edition, launched in 2009, claims sales of 120,000. Its foreign reports are often by correspondents from the People's Daily and Xinhua, the state news agency. Some hawkish commentaries are written by military and government officials under pseudonyms.
Before Mr Hu writes editorials, staff collect views from "prestige, mainstream" experts and officials. Pressed on whether he tests messages for those in power, he frowns, trying to answer precisely. For, to give him credit, Mr Hu is exceptionally willing to talk to outsiders, on social media and in person. His articles may reflect how officials "truly feel", he says, though such thoughts may not represent government policy. The paper tries to push controversial topics in a way that might coincide with leaders' thinking. "The knack is knowing when would be a good time."
The paper is profitable. "If we make ten yuan, we give the People's Daily three yuan and 50 cents," says Ms Yao. Mr Hu has a political mission, too: to nudge the party to be more transparent for its own good. The young Mr Hu took part in the Tiananmen protests in 1989. Mention of that tumult is taboo in the Chinese press but Global Times has written about it, in defence of the government. No one will say the army was right to kill hundreds in order to end the unrest, Mr Hu murmurs. "The words cannot even be uttered." He calls the military action a tragedy caused by student naivety and government inexperience. But after watching the Soviet Union's collapse and covering Yugoslavia's break-up as a war correspondent, he came to admire strong Communist rule.
In answer to Pilate's question
Mr Hu's candour is selective, notably when tackling domestic news. "In China what is truth?" he asks. "Micro-truth" is whether a particular incident happened. But his "macro-truth" is that the media must guide the public to see that its interests and the party's are fundamentally aligned. "China is so vast, if we report on corruption every day we won't see the end to it."
Twenty years ago liberal papers like Southern Weekly pushed at censors' boundaries. Today propaganda officials grant a rare licence to Mr Hu, and indeed sound positively fond of him in private. His pugnacity is catching. On September13th Li Xiaojun, from the State Council Information Office, told reporters at a un human-rights meeting that Xinjiang had to send extremists to vocational "training centres" because the West had failed to tackle Islamic extremism. "Look at Belgium, look at Paris, look at some other European countries," Mr Li scolded, sounding like the Global Times come to life-or like a man using a propaganda line tested on Western critics by Mr Hu. Frisbees can fly two ways.

全文文献: Headnote Our new China column takes its name from a meeting-place of ideas
GIVEN his love of Chinese teahouses, Mr Yang, a retired academic from Chengdu, was born in the right place at a terrible time. Within living memory his home town, the capital of Sichuan province, had boasted more than 600 teahouses, or chaguan. Some were famous for storytellers or opera. Others welcomed bird-lovers, who liked to suspend their pets in cages from teahouse eaves to show off their plumage and singing. Some served as rough-and-ready courtrooms for unlicensed lawyers (to "take discussion tea" was to seek mediation). One place might attract tattooed gangsters, another intellectuals. Wang Di of the University of Macau, a scholar of teahouses, cites an old editor who in the 1930s and 1940s ran his journal from a teashop table.
Mr Yang, who declined to give his full name, favours Heming teahouse, a lakeside tea garden where patrons may spend hours in bamboo armchairs, reading newspapers, munching melon seeds or paying a professional ear-cleaner to rootle away with metal skewers. But he has known more dangerous times. Soon after first visiting the teahouse as a child in the 1960s, such businesses were targeted when young, fanatical Red Guards roamed his city during the Cultural Revolution. "Back then everyone was busy chanting about revolution on the streets-this type of culture was criticised," he recalls. Slow tea-sipping was called timewasting, vain and bad. Maoist zealots closed teahouses.
This was not their first taste of repression. Before Communism, Chengdu endured iron-fisted rule by the Nationalist regime of Chiang Kai-shek. Despots with a bossy, scoutmasterly streak, the Nationalists issued dozens of orders to stamp out bad teahouse habits. Managers were told to report clients spreading political rumours. Bawdy songs were banned. Teahouses were told to expel itinerant barbers (who did sometimes drop hair clippings in other patrons' teacups, it is true). During the war with Japan, teahouses in Chengdu were ordered to display Nationalist flags, slogans and leaders' portraits, and to inscribe approved news headlines on blackboards. In 1948 Sichuan's governor demanded teahouse controls to "regulate people who do not follow rules" and "turn uselessness into usefulness".
Teahouses had been little safer during the first decades of the 20th century, when warlords had brought terror to cities, or even earlier in the dying days of the final imperial dynasty, the Qing. The author Lao She, who in 1956 charted a Beijing teashop's woes over a half-century in his play "Teahouse", drew on life when he had the establishment's manager pin up signs pleading "No talk of state affairs", or when he showed grey-gowned secret police arresting customers for questioning the government.
That teahouses managed equally to enrage Red Guards, Nationalist police chiefs and desiccated imperial mandarins might be reason enough to cherish them, and to name The Economist's new China column "Chaguan" in their honour. But teahouses are more than fine places that attracted the right enemies. In their heyday, when some city streets might have boasted half a dozen, they were places to relax, do business, gossip and exchange ideas, both lowbrow and highfalutin. Some teahouse litigators were crooks, writes Qin Shao of the College of New Jersey, another teahouse historian. But at its best, teashop mediation with crowds hearing every word, could expose and shame local bullies, offering a rough sort of accountability.
Like users of social media today, teahouse patrons loved tales of corruption, broken promises and immorality among the mighty. Some were false. Others contained enough truth to help explain why officials raged at them. A stubborn, indignant, often mocking resistance to finger-wagging propaganda is as much a Chinese tradition as deference to authority.
Officials have spent more than a century vowing to modernise China, promoting reforms that-certainly in the past 40 years-often demand the world's admiration. Chinese leaders argue that their vast country cannot risk the morale-sapping confusion that might be sown by a free press, independent courts or even civic groups with the right to criticise official wrongs. Anyone calling for democratic freedoms is attempting to infect China with dangerously alien, indeed Western notions, officials assert.
Yet such claims look questionable, not to mention self-serving, after reading historic accounts of teahouses and the unmistakably democratic impulses that sometimes moved customers. Even signs reading "No talk of state affairs" can be read as ironic symbols of protest against the suppression of free speech, as Wang Di has written. Similar democratic impulses can still be seen all over China, whenever citizens note that powers are being abused, mistakes covered up or that life seems unfair or absurd.
Teahouses are unlikely to boom again in Chengdu. Youngsters at Heming spoke of making time to "chill for the afternoon", as they are usually too busy. Tastes change. This writer was on a first China posting two decades ago when Starbucks opened its inaugural shop there, in Beijing. The chain plans to have 6,000 outlets in China by 2022, with one opening every 15 hours.
Orders for the doctor
But teahouses are more than places to buy a drink. They represent something precious: a space that is public yet not state-controlled, where citizens may speak, listen and be moved, find work, do deals or seek redress, or simply idle for a while. Today that spirit can be found online or in the gig economy, despite government controls. It is seen when citizens' groups report injustices, displaying a complex mix of distrust and trust in officials, whose help they seek while doubting what it can achieve.
"Chaguan" aims to cover that China, writing about society, the economy and culture. Long ago, in a spirit of teasing respect, teahouse waiters were dubbed "tea doctors". To be a tea doctor, patiently serving while patrons talk, seems a good ambition for a China columnist. Stoke the stove, then. To work. £
