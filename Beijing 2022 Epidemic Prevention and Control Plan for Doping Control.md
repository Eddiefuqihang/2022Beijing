### General Countermeasures

1. Everyone must wear N95 / KN95 medical protective masks during the doping control. Doping control staffs and volunteers shall also wear gloves and face shields or goggles. Sample collection personnel shall also wear disposable gowns and shoe covers.
2. Maintain a social distance of at least 1 meter, wherever possible considering the circumstances and the spaces in each case.
3. Avoid physical contact.

6. All staff and volunteers are not allowed to eat in the Doping Control Station.

### Countermeasures for Doping Control

1. Preparations before the tests
   1. Ventilation shall be done after opening the station every day and before Athletes entering the station. Doors and windows should be open for ventilation under the condition that there are no Athletes in the station. If the conditions for opening doors and windows are not met, the ventilation system shall be selected for ventilation by using the fresh air mode and closing the returning air system. Ventilation shall be conducted at least twice a day.
   2. Staff must wash their hands with liquid soap and running water or disinfect their hands with hand sanitizer, especially after touching eyes, nose, mouth, masks, frequently contacted surfaces, and when entering or leaving any room.
   3. Staff must place hand sanitizer on the check-in and check-out desk of the Doping Control Station and the table in each processing room.
   4. Daily disinfection should be done to the floor of each room, as well as all office supplies and daily necessities.
   5. Staff should wash their hands or disinfect their hands before placing drinks on the table.
   6. All staff and volunteers shall wear N95/KN95 masks all the time, besides, DCOs shall also wear disposable gown and shoe covers. They shall maintain the required social distance wherever possible considering the circumstances and the spaces in each case and avoid unnecessary physical contact with Athletes and their representatives and/or interpreters.

2. Preparations before the notification
   1. Chaperones must wash their hands or disinfect their hands before leaving the Doping Control Station. At the same time, they need to disinfect materials for notification. Chaperones shall carry at least two N95/KN95 masks as spare when leaving the station.
   2. Chaperones must keep the required social distance from Athletes and other personnel who participate in notification as much as possible, taking into account the circumstances and the spaces in each case.
   3. Chaperones must avoid any physical contact with other people, such as clapping and shaking hands, hugs etc.

3. Through the notification
   1. Chaperones shall keep the required social distance while contacting and talking with Athletes as much as possible, taking into account the circumstances and the spaces in each case.	
   2. When notifying Athletes, Chaperones should introduce themselves and show Athletes their AD card and authorizations. While verifying identities:
      1. Verify the identity of Athletes by the means designated by the Chaperone Coordinator, such as Athletes' AD card, numbered cloth etc.
      2. Chaperones could take off their masks briefly if the Athletes require to verify their identities. While taking off the masks, Chaperones shall take the ear ribbon to avoid touch the outside of mask, face, nose, or eyes.
      3. If the Athlete has worn the mask properly though the notification, Chaperones may ask Athletes to take off their masks briefly to verify the identities of Athletes.
      4. If Athletes do not wear masks or do not wear masks properly, Chaperones should ask Athletes to wear masks immediately after verifying their identities. If Athletes do not have masks, Chaperones should provide masks for Athletes.
      5. If the Athlete needs to return to the room to get the accreditation card, change clothes, be interviewed, attend a press conference, or receive necessary medical care, the Chaperone shall follow or remain observant as much as possible while maintaining the required social distance as much as possible, taking into account the circumstances and the spaces in each case and avoiding touching any item in the Athlete s room.
      6. During the notification session, if the Chaperone finds or is informed of symptoms such as fever, weakness, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle/joint pain, respiratory distress, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, abnormal taste, and so on by the Athlete, the chaperone will ask the athlete to inform his CLO and ask for an athlete s representative (coach or someone else) to come to the notification location. The Chaperone would then ask the athlete s representative to follow him/her to the Doping Control Station to fill out an SRF to be signed by the athlete s representative. The chaperone would report this immediately to the chaperone coordinator or the DCSM. The CC or DCSM shall report the situation to the venue's Disease Control and Prevention Manager as well as the DCCC. The DCCC shall then alert the ITA.

4. Waiting for Doping Control
   1. Hand sanitizer is provided at the check-in. All personnel, including Athletes, Athlete Representatives and Chaperones, must use hand sanitizer for hand disinfection when entering the Doping Control Station.
   2. Disinfect accreditation cards before providing them to the check in and check out administrator.
   3. Maintain the required social distance in the Doping Control Station as much as possible, taking into account the circumstances and the spaces in each case.
   4. If a large number of athletes arriving at the same time, the following measures might be taken:

      2. Require DCOs to stay in the processing room.

5. Sample Collection Process
   1. In certain circumstances (e.g., blood sample collection, space constraints, or the need to observe sample provision directly at close range), the recommended social distance may not be applicable. The DCO should then minimize the risk during the time of close contact by keeping the time of close contact as short as possible.
   2. Urine sample collection process
      1. The DCO must change a new pair of disposable gloves after conducting sample collection.
      2. The DCO may provide disposable gloves to Athletes.

Except for the preparation to provide urine samples in the toilet, where Athletes may only wash their hands with water according to the Doping Control procedures, the DCO shall instruct Athletes to wash their hands with liquid soap and running water or disinfect their hands with hand sanitizer after providing the sample.
      4. The DCO should keep as little equipment as possible on the work surface to avoid potential contamination.
   3. Blood sample collection process
      1. When collecting blood samples, the BCO should disinfect his/her hands after completing the sample collection and replace the protective equipment timely if required.
      2. The DCO should keep as little equipment as possible on the work surface to avoid potential contamination.
   4. After Completion of Sample Collection
      1. After sample collection, the DCO shall instruct the Athlete to properly remove the gloves and place them in the designated waste bin, if the Athlete is wearing them.

### Countermeasures for Sample Transportation

Samples shall be transferred to the laboratory by the sample transportation contractor. In order to effectively avoid cross-contact between the staff in the closed-loop area and the outside, and effectively protect the anti-epidemic screen from being damaged, in theory, the Athlete Village, competition venues and the medal plazas shall be connected through a non-contact handover method at the periphery of the closed-loop area fbr test samples to the laboratory, handover plan as follows:

1. The Doping Control Station Manager will negotiate with the VEM, PHS, TRA, SEC and other functional areas to delineate a doping control sample transportation handover area in the closed loop area which shall be as close as possible to the doping control station.
2. In principle, all sample transfer vehicles are not allowed to enter any closed loop area. The DCSM or the designated doping control personnel and security personnel shall deliver the samples to the handover area at specified time every day, and hand them over to the sample transportation contractor in a non-contact manner. During the transfer of samples to the handover area, the doping control personnel involved in the sample handover should take personal protection under the guidance of the venue PHS FA, and disinfect the surface of the transportation box where the samples are stored to ensure the venue’s anti-epidemic screen is not affected. After the sample transportation is completed, the handover area should be disinfected.
