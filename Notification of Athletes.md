# 5.0 Notification of Athletes

## 5.1 Objective

The objective is to ensure that an Athlete who has been selected for Testing is properly notified with no advance notice of Sample collection as outlined in Articles 5.3.1 and 5.4.1, that the rights of the Athlete are maintained, that there are no opportunities to manipulate the Sample to be provided, and that the notification is documented.

## 5.2 General

Notification of Athletes starts when the Sample Collection Authority initiates the notification of the selected Athlete and ends when the Athlete arrives at the Doping Control Station or when the Athlete's possible Failure to Comply has occurred. The main activities are:

- a) Appointment of DCOs, Chaperones and other Sample Collection Personnel sufficient to ensure No Advance Notice Testing and continuous observation of - Athletes notified of their selection to provide a Sample;
- b) Locating the Athlete and confirming their identity;
- c) Informing the Athlete that they have been selected to provide a Sample and of their rights and responsibilities;
- d) Continuously chaperoning the Athlete from the time of notification to the arrival at the designated Doping Control Station; and
- e) Documenting the notification, or notification attempt.

## 5.3 Requirements prior to notification of Athletes

### 5.3.1 

No Advance Notice Testing shall be the method for Sample collection save in exceptional and justifiable circumstances. The Athlete shall be the first Person notified that they have been selected for Sample collection, except where prior contact with a third party is required as specified in Article 5.3.7. In order to ensure that Testing is conducted on a No Advance Notice Testing basis, the Testing Authority (and the Sample Collection Authority, if different) shall ensure that Athlete selection decisions are only disclosed in advance of Testing to those who strictly need to know in order for such Testing to be conducted. Any notification to a third party shall be conducted in a secure and confidential manner so that there is no risk that the Athlete will receive any advance notice of their selection for Sample collection. For In-Competition Testing, such notification shall occur at the end of the Competition in which the Athlete is competing.
[Comment to 5.3.1: Every effort should be made to ensure Event Venue or training venue staff are not aware that Testing may take place in advance. It is not justifiable for a National Federation or other body to insist that it be given advance notice of Testing of Athletes under its authority so that it can have a representative present at such Testing.]

### 5.3.5 

The Sample Collection Authority, DCO or Chaperone, as applicable, shall establish the location of the selected Athlete and plan the approach and timing of notification, taking into consideration the specific circumstances of the sport/Competition/training session/etc. and the situation in question.

- c) Where an interpreter is required and available for the notification;
- d) Where required to assist Sample Collection Personnel to identify the Athlete(s) to be tested and to notify such Athlete(s) that they are required to provide a Sample.
  [Comment to 5.3.7: It is permissible to notify a third party that Testing of Minors or Athletes with impairments will be conducted. However, there is no requirement to notify any third party (eg, a team doctor) of the Doping Control mission where such assistance is not needed.
